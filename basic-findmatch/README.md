###  Info

designed the idea once, then expressed it naturally in each ecosystem:

__C#__ → String extension method returning a single value (idiomatic for __.NET__ at the time)

__Java__ → utility + tests returning a `Map<String, String>` (idiomatic, test-first, more general)

That’s exactly how how experienced engineers work when moving ideas across stacks

### Background

This is a standwlone Project dreiver from Java test class [`FindMatchTest.java`](https://github.com/sergueik/selenium_tests/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/sergueik/selenium/FindMatchTest.java)

Which in turn was a
Ported/Exteding
from c# [`Matcher.cs`](https://github.com/sergueik/powershell_selenium/blob/master/selenium4/csharp/basic/Extensions/Matcher.cs)
