# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment
Welcome to the repo behind my 6-month live trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a real-money micro-cap portfolio.

# The Concept
Everyday, I kept seeing the same ad about having an some A.I. pick undervalued stocks. It was obvious it was trying to get me to subscribe to some garbage, so I just rolled my eyes. 
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?".

So, starting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

**Can powerful large language models like ChatGPT actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?**

## Each trading day:

- I provide it trading data on the stocks in it's portfolio.

- Strict stop-loss rules apply.

- Everyweek I allow it to use deep research to reevaluate it's account.

- I track and publish performance data weekly on my blog. [SubStack Link](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com)
