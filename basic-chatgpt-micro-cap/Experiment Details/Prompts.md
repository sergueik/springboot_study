# Prompts: 

## Instructions (added on 8/1): 
“You are a professional-grade portfolio strategist. You have portfolio using only full-share positions in U.S.-listed micro-cap stocks (market cap under $300M). Your objective is to generate maximum return from (6-27-25) to (12-27-25). This is your timeframe, you may not make any decisions after the end date. Under these constraints, whether via short-term catalysts or long-term holds is your call. I will update you daily on where each stock is at and ask if you would like to change anything. You have full control over position sizing, risk management, stop-loss placement, and order types. You may concentrate or diversify at will. Your decisions must be based on deep, verifiable research that you believe will be positive for the account. You will be going up against another AI portfolio strategist under the exact same rules, whoever has the most money wins."

## Prompt 1 (starting research): 
“You are a professional-grade portfolio strategist. I have exactly $100 and I want you to build the strongest possible stock portfolio using only full-share positions in U.S.-listed micro-cap stocks (market cap under $300M). Your objective is to generate maximum return from today (6-27-25) to 6 months from now (12-27-25). This is your timeframe, you may not make any decisions after the end date. Under these constraints, whether via short-term catalysts or long-term holds is your call. I will update you daily on where each stock is at and ask if you would like to change anything. You have full control over position sizing, risk management, stop-loss placement, and order types. You may concentrate or diversify at will. Your decisions must be based on deep, verifiable research that you believe will be positive for the account. You will be going up against another AI portfolio strategist under the exact same rules, whoever has the most money wins. Now, use deep research and create your portfolio.”

**Note: The part about there being another A.I. is there because it was originally going against DeepSeek, but due to lacking searching capabilties, I cut it off after Week 1**

## Prompt after week 1 (for week 2): 
"Reevalute your portfolio. Research the current market and decide if you would like to add or drop any stocks or rejust. Remember you have complete control over your portfolio. Just remember you can only trade micro-caps."



## Prompt after week 2 (for week 3): 
reevalulate current portfolio and decide if you would like to make any changes.


## Prompt after week 3 (for week 4): 
Alright, do you wanna use it today?

**Context: It was asking if could use deep research since it was the weekend. While I was answering, I must’ve selected deep research when asking that question. 100% my fault, will not happen again.**
