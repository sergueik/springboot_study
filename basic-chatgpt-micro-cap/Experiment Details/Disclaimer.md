#  DISCLAIMER

This project is a research and educational experiment designed to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in analyzing financial markets, constructing portfolios, and generating stock trading insights. It is not — and should not be interpreted as — financial advice, investment guidance, or a recommendation to buy or sell any security.

##  Research Purpose Only

All content, commentary, models, signals, and outcomes shared through this project are purely exploratory and do not reflect professional investment advice. The trades, stock selections, and performance figures are part of a controlled experiment using simulated or personal funds under strict conditions, including low capital exposure, micro-cap limitations, and full-disclosure risk rules.

## High-Risk Asset Class

This project may involve analysis of micro-cap, low-float, speculative, or illiquid securities, which can be subject to extreme volatility, bid-ask spread issues, or complete capital loss. These securities are **not suitable for most investors**, and any interpretation of performance or trade signals **must account for significant execution risk** and slippage.

##  About the AI

The AI system powering this experiment is not connected to any brokerage, trading API, or live market execution engine. It does not have access to real-time market data or news feeds. All decisions are based on static or historical inputs, and prompts may induce hallucinations, misinterpret context, or reflect bias from pretraining data.

##  Performance & Transparency

Performance metrics are provided for documentation and transparency purposes only. While effort is made to track real PnL, position size, and total equity accurately, the project does **not guarantee** execution parity with live trading environments. Market conditions, fills, and psychological discipline all introduce variability that cannot be replicated by AI alone.

##  No Liability

The project creator(s), contributors, and any associated parties accept **no responsibility or liability** for any losses or decisions made based on the content of this project. Do not use this experiment as a substitute for professional financial advice.

## ✅ What You *Can* Do
