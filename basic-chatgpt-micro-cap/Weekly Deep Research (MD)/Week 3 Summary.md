## Portfolio Reallocation Summary

By implementing the above, the portfolio shifts toward higher-conviction positions. We are holding onto winners (ABEO, IINN) and strong stories (CADL), while cutting the weakest link (AZTR). The freed capital is redeployed into MIST (targeting a biotech catalyst) and CCLD (a growth-at-a-value play).

This strategy blends:
- **Biotech event-driven upside**
- **Tech/AI-driven growth exposure**

Both sectors are positioned to outperform the broader market into late 2025.

### Position Rationale:

- **Abeona (ABEO):**  
  Hold for commercial execution of a newly approved therapy. Still undervalued relative to cash and pipeline potential.

- **Candel (CADL):**  
  Maintain position. 2025 may be a quiet year, but long-term oncology payoff remains promising.

- **Azitra (AZTR):**  
  Sell/rotate out due to funding risks and a binary outcome profile that no longer fits the high-conviction mandate.

- **Inspira (IINN):**  
  Add/Hold to capitalize on real revenue momentum and government-backed support.

- **Milestone (MIST):**  
  Initiate position as a high-reward catalyst trade into a December FDA decision.

- **CareCloud (CCLD):**  
  Buy based on undervaluation and emerging AI-driven growth narrative.

By focusing the portfolio on high-conviction, catalyst-backed ideas, we aim to maximize return potential. We will monitor each position closely and adjust using stop-losses and position sizing as needed. Barring major macro disruptions, this revised micro-cap portfolio is well-positioned to outperform heading into year-end.
