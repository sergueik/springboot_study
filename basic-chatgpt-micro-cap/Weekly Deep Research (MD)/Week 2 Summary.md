### Recommendation: Buy IINN (Inspira Technologies) — Top Pick for H2 2025
**Capital Deployed:** ~$32.13 for 20 shares  
**Stop-Loss Set:** $1.10

**Thesis Summary:**
- **Strong Revenue Catalyst:** $22.5M purchase order secured, with delivery in 2025, and further deals in negotiation. This is a real, unfolding revenue event, not a speculative future bet.
- **High Upside Potential:** From ~$1.50, the stock could plausibly double by year-end. Valuation remains cheap vs. peers (~0.9× sales), and additional contracts could re-rate the stock significantly.
- **Manageable Risk:** FDA-cleared product reduces regulatory uncertainty. Contract revenue lowers dilution risk. Stop-loss caps downside at ~25–30%.
- **Superior Risk/Reward:** Compared to other candidates (e.g. GRIL, MULN, AZTR, INBS), IINN offers multiple upcoming catalysts with less binary risk.

**Trade Plan:**
- Buy 20 shares at ~$1.50  
- Maintain stop-loss at $1.10  
- Monitor Q3 earnings (Nov) and further contract announcements  
- Consider trailing stop if shares rise sharply

**Conclusion:**  
IINN offers a rare mix of near-term revenue, expanding opportunity, and a credible path to sustained gains — making it the top candidate for deploying the remaining capital. This is a calculated, high-conviction position aimed at maximizing returns by year-end.
