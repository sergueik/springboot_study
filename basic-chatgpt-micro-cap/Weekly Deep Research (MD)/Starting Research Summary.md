## Portfolio Summary and Allocation

With a $100 capital and a 6-month horizon, we’ve constructed a concentrated micro-cap portfolio aiming for maximum return. All picks are U.S.-listed micro-cap stocks (sub-$300M market caps) chosen for strong catalysts or growth potential by December 27, 2025.

We’ve balanced high-upside biotech plays with an AI/tech growth stock, and we’ll actively manage risk through position sizing and stop-loss orders.

### Initial Portfolio Allocation:

- **Abeona Therapeutics (ABEO)** – 6 shares ≈ $36 (36% of portfolio)  
- **Candel Therapeutics (CADL)** – 5 shares ≈ $28 (28% of portfolio)  
- **Cloudastructure Inc (CSAI)** – 15 shares ≈ $30 (30% of portfolio)  
- **Cash Reserve:** ≈ $6 (6% cash for flexibility or fees)

Each stock is a full-share position and was selected based on verifiable positive research and upcoming catalysts. Below we detail the thesis for each holding and our risk management plan.
