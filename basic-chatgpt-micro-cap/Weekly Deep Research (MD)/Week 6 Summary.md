# Current Thesis Summary (Week of August 5, 2025)

## ABEO – Abeona Therapeutics
Catalyst: FDA-approved gene therapy ZEVASKYN launching now for RDEB.

Thesis: Strong first-mover advantage in a rare disease with premium pricing. Well-capitalized after $155M PRV sale, with 2+ years of cash runway. Commercial launch de-risks the story.

Risk/Reward: Low downside (already approved); upside tied to launch ramp and potential early profitability by 2026.

## IINN – Inspira Technologies
Catalyst: $22.5M order for ART100 device + Nasdaq compliance regained.

Thesis: Validated product-market fit with large order; positioning to scale globally, including government health partnerships. Bullish momentum post-compliance.

Risk/Reward: Trimmed profits but still upside from additional contracts and scaling.

## AXGN – Axogen
Catalyst: FDA decision for Avance Nerve Graft expected September 5, 2025.

Thesis: Binary event with asymmetric setup. Even if approval fails, revenue growth (+17% YoY) and near-breakeven ops limit downside. If approved, potential breakout.

Risk/Reward: Moderate risk, high upside. Holding through catalyst.

## ESPR – Esperion Therapeutics
Catalyst: Continued sales growth + potential EU milestone resolution.

Thesis: Turnaround cholesterol drug play with +41% YoY U.S. sales and $114M cash runway into 2026. Multiple upside drivers (profitability, partnerships, EU settlement).

Risk/Reward: Commercial-stage biotech diversification with multi-bagger upside on execution.

## ACTU – Actuate Therapeutics
Catalyst: Positive Phase 2 results in pancreatic cancer.

Thesis: High-risk oncology play with standout survival data. Strong KOL support and big market. Recent $4.7M raise helps, but going-concern warning adds risk.

Risk/Reward: Multi-bagger potential if data drives attention. Strict stop-loss enforced to manage tail risk.

## Portfolio Strategy
We remain concentrated in catalyst-rich micro-caps with clear paths to price inflection. Our thesis balances:

Near-term events (ABEO launch, AXGN FDA decision),

Ongoing growth (ESPR, IINN),

High-conviction moonshots (ACTU).

All positions are actively risk-managed. The sole focus is generating alpha, and current holdings provide a well-balanced exposure into late 2025.
