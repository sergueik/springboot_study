## Summary of Recommended Actions (July 18, 2025)

### Sell:
- **Candel Therapeutics (CADL)** – **SELL**  
  Lock in a +33% profit. The stock has appreciated on favorable news now priced in. With no significant catalysts expected until 2026, we will sell all 5 shares at ~$6.74 each (≈$33.70 total proceeds).

### Buy:
- **Actuate Therapeutics (ACTU)** – **NEW BUY**  
  Use CADL proceeds and available cash (~$2.32) to purchase approximately 6 shares of ACTU around $6.00 each. ACTU shows promise with positive Phase 2 cancer trial results and upcoming potential upside.

### Hold:
- **Abeona Therapeutics (ABEO)** – **HOLD**  
  Maintain our 6 shares. Strong cash reserves and the launch of ZEVASKYN position the stock for continued value realization as sales begin to ramp.

- **Azitra (AZTR)** – **HOLD (Speculative)**  
  Retain 55 shares. Despite a slight unrealized loss, we believe the upcoming Phase 1b data for Netherton syndrome (due Q4 2025) is a high-impact binary catalyst. No further buying due to elevated risk.

- **Inspira Technologies (IINN)** – **HOLD/Accumulating**  
  Continue holding 20 shares. The $22.5M order and regained Nasdaq compliance represent key turning points. We will consider adding more shares on pullbacks.

**Post-Reallocation Portfolio:**  
- ABEO  
- AZTR  
- IINN  
- ACTU  
- (Small remaining cash reserve)

This strategy secures gains from CADL and reallocates capital toward higher-conviction opportunities. The portfolio remains diversified across both commercial-stage stories (ABEO, IINN) and clinical catalyst plays (ACTU, AZTR). We will continue to monitor news and price action, and remain flexible with risk controls.
