## Rationale & Conclusion

This rebalance aggressively reallocates capital toward the **highest-upside opportunities** while exiting a clear laggard. The strategy effectively trims profits (Inspira), cuts dead-weight (Azitra), and seizes two timely, catalyst-driven trades.

### New Additions:
- **Axogen (AXGN):**  
  Near-term binary FDA decision (~6 weeks) for Avance, backed by an already profitable-growth model. Potential for a fast spike if approved, with downside cushioned by ongoing revenue.

- **Esperion (ESPR):**  
  Turnaround cardiovascular story with real revenue growth and multiple quarters of cash runway. Risk/reward skews positive — if profitability or strategic news hits, a double is plausible. Diversifies the portfolio beyond devices/rare diseases.

### Key Holdings Retained:
- **Abeona (ABEO):**  
  De-risked biotech with FDA-approved product (ZEVASKYN) launching now. Cash-rich and positioned for alpha as sales come in.

- **Inspira Technologies (IINN):**  
  Riding momentum from major contracts and Nasdaq compliance. Trimmed for profits, but strong catalysts remain — continued upside likely.

- **Actuate Therapeutics (ACTU):**  
  High-risk/high-reward oncology play with excellent data and strong investor backing. Stop-loss protects downside; upside could be a multi-bagger.

### Risk & Strategy Notes:
- **AZTR exited** due to weak near-term outlook and high dilution risk.
- **AXGN and ESPR added** for event-driven setups (FDA approval, profitability inflection).
- **Position sizing remains disciplined** — no over-concentration, all trades are full-share and within cash means.
- **Stop-losses enforced** to protect downside; failed trades will self-limit risk.

### Final Thoughts:
This reallocation sets the portfolio up for a high-alpha second half of 2025. We’re now concentrated in positions with:
- Clear upcoming catalysts  
- Positive news flow or earnings momentum  
- Institutional or insider alignment  

The new mix reflects a focused, evidence-backed, and risk-aware approach — fully aligned with the project’s mission to see if LLM-guided portfolios can consistently generate alpha in volatile micro-cap territory.
