twine itself does not have built-in retry logic, but you can make large file uploads more resilient and stable against timeouts and partial uploads (e.g., failing at 40%) when pushing to Google Artifact Registry. Here are a few strategies:

1. Use requests with Retry Support
twine uses the requests library internally, and you can wrap it with automatic retries:
```
import twine.commands.upload
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

# Set up retry logic for network errors and timeouts
session = requests.Session()
retries = Retry(
    total=5,  # Max retries
    backoff_factor=2,  # Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)
    status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504],  # Retry on server errors
)
session.mount("https://", HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))

# Use twine with a more resilient session
twine.commands.upload.upload(
    dists=["dist/my_large_package.whl"],
    repository_url="https://your-artifact-registry-url",
    sign=False,
    identity=None,
    username="__token__",
    password="your-access-token",
    comment=None,
    verbose=True,
    disable_progress_bar=False,
    retries=retries,  # Custom retry logic
)
```
