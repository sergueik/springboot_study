You can test if a line matches one of several patterns in Python without merging them into a single hard-to-understand regular expression by using multiple re.search calls, each targeting a specific pattern. This approach keeps each pattern clear and easy to modify.

```
import re

# Define the patterns you want to match
patterns = [
    r"downloading foo\.bar",        # Match "downloading foo.bar"
    r"goo\.baz have been downloaded",  # Match "goo.baz have been downloaded"
    r"using cached boo\.pam"        # Match "using cached boo.pam"
]

# Function to check if any pattern matches
def match_any_pattern(line):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, line):
            return True
    return False

# Test the function
test_lines = [
    "downloading foo.bar",
    "goo.baz have been downloaded",
    "using cached boo.pam",
    "some other line"
]

for line in test_lines:
    if match_any_pattern(line):
        print(f"Pattern matched in line: {line}")
    else:
        print(f"No pattern matched in line: {line}")
```
