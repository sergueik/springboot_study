write basic python program to pull docker image from google cloud using python artifact registry sdk

Here's a basic Python program to pull a Docker image from Google Cloud's Artifact Registry using the google-cloud-artifact-registry SDK and the docker Python library (Docker SDK for Python).
Prerequisites:
    1. Install required libraries:
       pip install google-cloud-artifact-registry docker
    2. Authenticate with Google Cloud:
       gcloud auth application-default login

       or if using a service account:

       gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=your-key.json
    3. Configure docker to use Google Artifact Registry:

       gcloud auth configure-docker

Python Program:

from google.cloud import artifactregistry_v1
import docker

# Define the Google Artifact Registry details
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "your-region"  # e.g., "us-central1"
REPOSITORY = "your-repo-name"
IMAGE_NAME = "your-image-name"
IMAGE_TAG = "latest"

# Construct the full image path
IMAGE_PATH = f"{LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/{PROJECT_ID}/{REPOSITORY}/{IMAGE_NAME}:{IMAGE_TAG}"

def pull_image():
    # Initialize Docker client
    client = docker.from_env()

    try:
        print(f"Pulling image: {IMAGE_PATH}...")
        image = client.images.pull(IMAGE_PATH)
        print(f"Successfully pulled image: {image.tags}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to pull image: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pull_image()

Explanation:
    1. Google Artifact Registry Client:
        â—¦ This script does not directly interact with google-cloud-artifact-registry, but Google authentication (gcloud auth configure-docker) is necessary to authenticate Docker to pull images from Artifact Registry.
    2. Docker SDK:
        â—¦ The script uses the docker Python package to pull an image from Google Cloud's Artifact Registry.
        â—¦ The client.images.pull(IMAGE_PATH) command fetches the image.
    3. Authentication:
        â—¦ Ensure gcloud auth configure-docker has been run to configure Docker authentication.

Example Image Path:
If your project ID is my-project, region is us-central1, repository is my-repo, and image is my-app with tag v1, the full path would be:
sh
CopyEdit
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-app:v1
Run the script, and it should pull the image successfully! ðŸš€

interested to see use of get_docker_image method
ChatGPT said:
The get_docker_image method is part of the google.cloud.artifactregistry_v1 API, which allows you to retrieve metadata about a Docker image stored in Google Artifact Registry. However, it does not pull the imageâ€”it only fetches metadata like tags, size, and digests.
Hereâ€™s how you can use get_docker_image in a Python script:

Prerequisites:
    1. Install the Google Cloud Artifact Registry client:
       sh
       CopyEdit
       pip install google-cloud-artifact-registry
    2. Authenticate with Google Cloud:
       sh
       CopyEdit
       gcloud auth application-default login
       or use a service account:
       sh
       CopyEdit
       gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=your-key.json

```
from google.cloud import artifactregistry_v1

# Define Google Cloud project details
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "your-region"  # e.g., "us-central1"
REPOSITORY = "your-repo-name"
IMAGE_NAME = "your-image-name"
IMAGE_TAG = "latest"  # or use a digest instead

def get_image_metadata():
    # Create the Artifact Registry client
    client = artifactregistry_v1.ArtifactRegistryClient()

    # Construct the image resource name
    image_resource = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/repositories/{REPOSITORY}/dockerImages/{IMAGE_NAME}@{IMAGE_TAG}"

    try:
        # Fetch metadata
        docker_image = client.get_docker_image(name=image_resource)
        
        # Print image metadata
        print(f"Image Name: {docker_image.name}")
        print(f"Image Tags: {docker_image.tags}")
        print(f"Image Digest: {docker_image.digest}")
        print(f"Image Size (bytes): {docker_image.image_size_bytes}")
        print(f"Upload Time: {docker_image.upload_time}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to get image metadata: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_image_metadata()

Explanation:
    â€¢ Artifact Registry Client: The script initializes a ArtifactRegistryClient() instance.
    â€¢ Constructing the Image Path: Uses the format:

      projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/repositories/{REPOSITORY}/dockerImages/{IMAGE_NAME}@{IMAGE_TAG}

      You can replace @{IMAGE_TAG} with @sha256:<digest> if you want to specify an image by digest.
    â€¢ Fetching Image Metadata: Calls get_docker_image to retrieve details like:
        â—¦ Tags
        â—¦ Digest
        â—¦ Size
        â—¦ Upload time
    â€¢ Error Handling: Catches exceptions if the image is not found.

Example Output:

Image Name: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/dockerImages/my-app@sha256:abc123...
Image Tags: ['latest', 'v1']
Image Digest: sha256:abc123...
Image Size (bytes): 104857600
Upload Time: 2024-02-08T12:34:56Z


The docker_image.uri field returned by get_docker_image contains the fully qualified name (FQN) of the Docker image in Google Artifact Registry.

If your image is stored in Google Artifact Registry, the URI follows this pattern:

LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE_NAME@sha256:DIGEST
or

LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE_NAME:TAG



To list available Docker images in a specific Google Artifact Registry repository using the list_docker_images method from the ArtifactRegistryClient, you can follow the steps below. This script will display the names and tags of the Docker images stored in your specified repository.

Prerequisites:

Install the Google Cloud Artifact Registry Client Library:

Ensure you have the google-cloud-artifact-registry library installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install google-cloud-artifact-registry
Set Up Authentication:

Authenticate your environment to access Google Cloud services. You can do this by setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your service account key file:

bash
Copy
Edit
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
Python Script:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.cloud import artifactregistry_v1

def list_docker_images(project_id, location, repository_id):
    """
    Lists all Docker images in the specified Artifact Registry repository.

    Args:
        project_id (str): Google Cloud project ID.
        location (str): The location of the repository (e.g., 'us-central1').
        repository_id (str): The ID of the repository.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Create a client
    client = artifactregistry_v1.ArtifactRegistryClient()

    # Construct the parent path
    parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/repositories/{repository_id}"

    # List Docker images
    try:
        docker_images = client.list_docker_images(parent=parent)
        print(f"Docker images in repository '{repository_id}':\n")
        for image in docker_images:
            print(f"Image Name: {image.name}")
            print(f"Image Tags: {', '.join(image.tags) if image.tags else 'No tags'}")
            print(f"Image Digest: {image.digest}")
            print(f"Image Size (bytes): {image.image_size_bytes}")
            print(f"Upload Time: {image.upload_time}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while listing Docker images: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace these variables with your project details
    project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
    location = "your-repository-location"  # e.g., 'us-central1'
    repository_id = "your-repository-id"

    list_docker_images(project_id, location, repository_id)
Explanation:

Client Initialization: The script initializes the ArtifactRegistryClient from the google.cloud library.

Parent Path Construction: It constructs the parent path in the format required by the list_docker_images method: projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/repositories/{repository_id}.

Listing Docker Images: The list_docker_images method is called with the parent path. The script then iterates through the returned Docker images, printing details such as the image name, tags, digest, size, and upload time.

Note: Ensure that the project_id, location, and repository_id variables are set to match your Google Cloud project's details.
