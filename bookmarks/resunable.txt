Use gcloud artifacts Instead (Recommended for Google Artifact Registry)
Since twine lacks retry logic, Google recommends using gcloud artifacts packages upload for resumable uploads:
```
gcloud artifacts packages upload my-package \
  --location=us \
  --repository=my-repo \
  --source=dist/my_large_package.whl
```
Supports resumable uploads
More stable for large files
