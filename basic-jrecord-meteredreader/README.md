### 🎯 Baby-goal simplified file processor

#### 1️⃣ Assumptions

| Aspect | Assumption in simplified project |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Line validity | Every line is valid; no validation errors expected |
| Inter-line dependencies | None; lines are independent |
| Failure recovery | None; if a worker fails, the whole run fails |
| Restartability | Not supported |
| Metrics | Optional, lightweight; mainly throughput |
| Thread safety | Trivial; each worker owns its own file chunk |

---

#### 2️⃣ Responsibilities

- Split a **big file** into **N chunks** (`chunkFile`)  
- Assign each chunk to a **ChunkWorker**  
- Process chunks in parallel using a **fixed thread pool**  
- Optionally log per-worker **lines processed / progress**  
- Measure **throughput / elapsed time** to study acceleration vs chunk count and pool size  

---

#### 3️⃣ Benchmarking intent

You are explicitly targeting **performance prediction**:

| Parameter | What to test |
|-----------|--------------|
| Number of chunks | e.g., 10, 50, 100 |
| Thread pool size | e.g., 10 |
| Metrics | Wall-clock time, throughput |
| Observation | Acceleration vs number of chunks / threads |

- Expect **linear acceleration up to a point** (e.g., 10 threads + 10 chunks → ~10× speed improvement)  
- Diminishing returns as chunks increase beyond a threshold (50 → 100 chunks)  

This gives you **empirical insight** before committing to Spring Batch complexity.

---

#### 4️⃣ Advantages of freezing this version

1. **Controlled benchmark**  
   - Only parsing logic affects performance; no external Spring Batch metadata overhead  
2. **Predictable behavior**  
   - Every run is deterministic for given chunk/thread configuration  
3. **Simple tuning knobs**  
   - Adjust `chunkSize` and `poolSize` independently  
4. **Baseline for next target**  
   - Provides a “speed ceiling” reference when you eventually migrate to Spring Batch

### NOTE



So your output:

ParseRecords copybook:example.cbl ...
Processed 10 records in 6 ms
... hundreds of times


means:

__JMH___ is invoking your @Benchmark method in a loop to gather statistically meaningful timing data.

This is intentional and required for accuracy.

By default JMH uses time-based iterations, not count-based.

Each iteration runs for about 1 second (default):
### Cons Pros
## Hot-Path vs End-to-End Spring Batch Benchmarking

When benchmarking a system with Spring Batch and jRecord parsing, there are **two main approaches**, each with distinct trade-offs.

### 1️⃣ Hot-Path / Microbenchmark

**Goal:** Measure the actual work you care about (e.g., jRecord parsing) as cleanly as possible.

**Characteristics:**
- Calls only the **core method(s)** (`CopyBookReader.parseRecord`)
- Uses **in-memory input**, minimal setup
- Can be parallelized easily (ExecutorService / ForkJoinPool / Spring Batch Step TaskExecutor)
- Logging silenced → no noisy output
- JMH-friendly: iterations, warmup, forks controlled

**Advantages:**
- Measures **true acceleration** from chunking, multi-threading, or code changes
- Results are reproducible and interpretable
- Lightweight: no Spring Batch or DB overhead
- Faster iterations → quicker tuning and experimentation

**Challenges:**
- Not “realistic” end-to-end: ignores Spring Batch infrastructure
- No insight into framework-induced delays, transaction commits, or listeners
- May be dismissed by some developers as “not the full job”

**When to use:** To optimize and compare **algorithmic improvements** or parallelization effects.

---

### 2️⃣ End-to-End / Job Benchmark

**Goal:** Measure performance of **the full Spring Batch Job**, including all Steps, readers, writers, and infrastructure.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses Spring Boot / Spring Batch context, JobLauncher, JobRepository, StepExecution
- Might include in-memory or DB-based readers/writers
- Parallel execution controlled via TaskExecutor in Steps
- Logging may be suppressed for clarity

**Advantages:**
- Shows **realistic throughput** in production-like scenario
- Includes framework overhead, so results represent what users actually experience
- Good for **capacity planning**

**Challenges:**
- High overhead: Spring Batch setup, context initialization, listeners, commit operations dominate runtime
- Harder to isolate improvements in the “hot path”
- Slow iterations → slower JMH benchmarking
- Results are noisier, harder to attribute to a single change
- Requires careful configuration to silence logging and avoid extra I/O

**When to use:** To benchmark **end-to-end job performance** or **validate production throughput**, after microbenchmarks are stable.

---

### 🔹 Summary Table

| Aspect | Hot-path | End-to-end job |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| What is measured | Core processing / algorithm | Full Spring Batch execution |
| Overhead | Minimal | Significant (Step, JobLauncher, listeners) |
| Reproducibility | High | Medium |
| Iteration speed | Fast | Slow |
| Insights | Pure acceleration | Realistic throughput |
| Complexity | Low | High |

---

### ✅ Practical approach

1. **Start with hot-path benchmark** to tune the core jRecord logic and parallel chunk processing.
2. **Optionally run end-to-end job benchmark** to see how framework overhead affects actual throughput.
3. **Document both** — it’s very persuasive:
   - “raw acceleration = X ops/sec, full job throughput = Y ops/sec”

> Essentially, **hot-path is usually the winner** for understanding performance improvements.
> End-to-end benchmarks are more for validation and real-world context.

### Bottom Line
JobLauncher is the library interface for starting a Spring Batch Job.

You cannot call jobLauncher.run() meaningfully without a Spring context containing the Job and Step beans.

In a JMH benchmark:

Initialize Spring context once:
```java
@Setup(Level.Trial)
public void setup() {
    context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
    context.register(BatchConfig.class); // your Job/Step beans
    context.refresh();

    jobLauncher = context.getBean(JobLauncher.class);
    job = context.getBean(Job.class);
}
```
Fetch JobLauncher and Job beans.  Benchmark calls:
```java
@Benchmark
public void runFullJob() throws Exception {
    jobLauncher.run(job, params);
}
```
Close context after all iterations:
```java
@TearDown(Level.Trial)
public void tearDown() {
   context.close();
}
```

If one is calling Spring Batch code without a context:

  * There is no `JobLauncher` bean
  * There is no `JobRepository`, `StepExecution`, or `Step` beans
  * Calling `new SimpleJobLauncher()` manually is possible, but one will need to manually configure the `JobRepository`, `PlatformTransactionManager`, etc. — essentially re-implementing the Spring Batch plumbing.

Spring Batch is not a standalone process. It runs inside a Spring context. Normally you get JobLauncher by:
```java
@Autowired
private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

@Autowired
private Job job;
```

or via manual context setup:

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
context.register(BatchConfig.class); // your @Configuration with Job/Step beans
context.refresh();
```
## 🔑 Concise Ranking Table (Key Arguments Only)

| Criterion | **#1 Console App (CLI + Threads + Chunks)** | **#2 Spring CommandLineRunner (wraps #1)** | **#3 Spring Batch Job** |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Control of chunk & thread parameters | ⭐⭐⭐ **Full, direct** | ⭐⭐⭐ **Same as #1** | ⭐ Framework-controlled |
| Code reuse from baseline | ⭐ Native | ⭐ Full reuse | ❌ Rewrite required |
| Framework in hot path | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Yes |
| Validity of JMH performance findings | ⭐⭐⭐ Strong | ⭐⭐⭐ Strong | ⭐ Weak / assumed |
| Effort vs performance insight | ⭐⭐⭐ Best ROI | ⭐⭐ Good | ⭐ Low ROI |
| Risk of fighting the framework | ❌ None | ❌ None | ⭐ High |

---

## 🏆 Final Ranking (by stated priorities)

1. **#1 Console App** – baseline & performance lab
2. **#2 Spring CommandLineRunner** – same engine, better wiring
3. **#3 Spring Batch** – different engine, uncertain carryover

---

## 🧠 One-paragraph takeaway

The console implementation (#1) allows direct control of chunking and threading and is therefore the most reliable environment for discovering performance gains with JMH. These gains transfer trivially to the Spring CommandLineRunner variant (#2) because the same code path is reused. In contrast, Spring Batch (#3) enforces its own execution model, requires rewriting the core loop, and makes performance improvements only “expected to hold” rather than demonstrably reproducible.
