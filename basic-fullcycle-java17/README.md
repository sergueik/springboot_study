### Info

this is a replica of [example project](https://github.com/Diamis/docker-java)

it builds and runs java app in container started by `docker-compose`. The goal is to run java app as nonroot user and do not have any root ownerartifacts in the workspace after the completion

### Prerequisites

if the `docker-compose` installed  by `apt-get` it is too old. However it is OK to install `docker-compose` via apt-get first for dependency sake. NOTE: the download instruction from [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04) modified to put the script into `/usr/bin` instead of `/usr/local/bin`
```sh
VERSION=2.14.0
sudo curl -sL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v$VERSION/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o docker-compose
sudo chmod 775 docker-compose
sudo cp docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

### Usage

* pull images

```sh
docker pull maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17
docker pull openjdk:17
docker pull openjdk:17-alpine3.14
```
it is over 1Gb worth of disk, counting build and run containers
```text
maven            3.8.3-openjdk-17        0b9ddcb8259e   12 months ago   785MB
openjdk          17                      5e28ba2b4cdb   6 months ago    471MB
openjdk          17-alpine               264c9bdce361   17 months ago   326MB
```

*  build
```sh
./build.sh | tee build.log
```
this runs `Dockerfile.build` as non-root user to create the maven `target` directory  in the project directory (does not like it to owned by the root user), followed by constructing a skeleton Java 17 container with similar non-root user to feed to `docker-compose`

*  create cluster
```sh
docker-compose up
```
this runs the java 17 app as `docker-compose` service mounted the current directory of workspace as applicaation writable `/app` dir.
* interact with app
```sh
curl http://localhost:8585
```
check file attributes
```sh
stat *txt
```
* if 
```text
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```
the docker is misconfigured
* the expected is
```text
access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/sergueik)   Gid: ( 1000/sergueik)
```
* interact with app running in alpine container
```sh
curl http://localhost:8586
```
the log will be created


### Cleanup

```sh
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm -f
```
the explicit image cleanup appears to be required:

```sh
 docker image ls | grep sample-java17| awk '{print $3}' | xargs -IX docker image rm X
```
### NOTE 

the `/usr/local/bin/mvn-entrypoint.sh` in the image `maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17`
is invoked and proudces the warning messages:
```text
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/root’: Permission denied
```
```text
Can not write to /root/.m2/copy_reference_file.log. Wrong volume permissions? Carrying on ...

```
* inspect the image
```sh
docker inspect maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17 | jq '.[]|.Config.Env'

```
```json
[
  "PATH=/usr/java/openjdk-17/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
  "JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/openjdk-17",
  "LANG=C.UTF-8",
  "JAVA_VERSION=17.0.1",
  "MAVEN_HOME=/usr/share/maven",
  "MAVEN_CONFIG=/root/.m2"
]

```
```sh
 docker inspect maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17 | jq '.[]|.Config.Entrypoint'
```
```json
[
  "/usr/local/bin/mvn-entrypoint.sh"
]

```

the build should normally be run by root, is is tweaked to have `target` mapped

### TODO

update `pom.xml` and container configurations to have pinned jar name
```xml
<configuration>
  <finalName>${finalName}</finalName>
</configuration>
```
