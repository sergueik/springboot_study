# Diagnose - Investigate failed BPMN runs

Capability index for post-run investigation.
Diagnose owns the diagnostic priority ladder for BPMN Process Orchestration runs: incidents, runtime variables,
deployed BPMN asset correlation, element executions, cursors, generated package metadata, and traces.

> **Where you came from / where to go next.** Diagnose is downstream of Operate (a debug or deployed run failed, hung,
> or behaved unexpectedly) and points back to Author for source fixes.
> Running and lifecycle live in [operate/CAPABILITY.md](../operate/CAPABILITY.md);
> source fixes live in [registry-workflow.md](../registry-workflow.md).
>
> **Inherits universal rules from [SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md).** BPMN source is model-authored; generated package files
> and Integration Service enrichment are CLI-owned.
> Use `uip maestro bpmn ... --output json` for diagnostic reads and redact private runtime data in summaries.

## When to use this capability

- Triage a failed debug or deployed process run.
- Read incidents and faulting element IDs.
- Inspect runtime variables and element executions.
- Fetch the deployed BPMN asset when local files may differ.
- Map runtime failures back to BPMN source and generated package metadata.
- Identify failures caused by unresolved Integration Service enrichment, bad bindings, missing diagrams, invalid mappings,
  or stale package files.
- Decide whether the safe next action is retry, cancel, migrate, cursor movement, re-authoring, package regeneration,
  or cloud configuration repair.

## Critical rules

1. **Investigate in priority order** - context, incidents, runtime variables, deployed BPMN asset,
   element executions/cursors, generated package files, then traces. For failed
   BPMN run triage, always execute the deployed asset read
   `uip maestro bpmn instance asset <INSTANCE_ID> -f <FOLDER_KEY> --output json`
   before writing the diagnosis, even when incidents and variables already
   reveal the likely root cause.
2. **Always include folder context on instance and incident reads** - `instance` commands require `--folder-key` or `-f`,
   and `incident get` requires `--folder-key`.
3. **Use the CLI as the diagnostic interface** - run `uip maestro bpmn ... --output json` reads. When mock or fixture
   files are present in a test harness, treat them as CLI backing data and do not read those files directly unless you
   are explicitly debugging the mock harness.
4. **Fetch deployed BPMN when local source may differ** - do not assume the working tree matches what ran.
5. **Map failures to BPMN element IDs** - use IDs to identify the source node, gateway, event, sequence flow,
   or extension that needs Author work.
6. **Separate runtime symptoms from ownership of the fix** - BPMN structure and mappings belong in Author;
   Integration Service enrichment and generated JSON come from CLI generation;
   folder/process/release choices belong to cloud configuration.
7. **Do not expose private runtime data** - redact tenant, user, connection, folder, URL, payload,
   and secret values in summaries.
8. **Do not mutate while diagnosing** - retry, cancel, migrate, and cursor movement are Operate actions and require
   explicit user consent after root cause analysis.

## Anti-patterns

- **Never start with verbose traces when incidents are available.**
- **Never call runtime lifecycle commands while diagnosing.** Diagnose reads; Operate mutates after explicit consent.
- **Never assume local BPMN is the deployed asset.**
- **Never retry before root cause is known.**
- **Never paste private incident payloads or connection details into docs, commits, or issue comments.**
- **Never patch generated package files as the only fix for a BPMN source defect.**
