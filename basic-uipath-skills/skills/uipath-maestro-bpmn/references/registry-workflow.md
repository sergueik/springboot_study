# Registry workflow

Every `uipath:*` payload in a Maestro `.bpmn` comes from the registry — never
from prose, never hand-written. This file is the loop for turning user intent
into registry-backed XML.

## 1. Sync and discover

```bash
uip maestro bpmn registry pull            # sync + cache (login for connectors/processes)
uip maestro bpmn registry list --limit -1 --output json   # all extension types
uip maestro bpmn registry search <keyword> --output json  # find a type by intent
uip is connections list --all-folders --output json   # live IS connections (all folders)
```

Map the user's intent to an extension type from the list. Confirm the choice
with the user (and the specific connection / process / queue) before authoring.
**Never fabricate an identifier** — see [cli-conventions.md](cli-conventions.md).

**Connection discovery must be exhaustive.** Always pass `--all-folders` to
`uip is connections list` — connections live in many folders and a folder-scoped
listing silently misses them. An empty or unmatched result from a missing
`--all-folders`, or from a connector key guessed from a brand name rather than
found via `registry search`, is a **false negative** — never conclude "no
connection exists" or ask the user to create one until you have searched the
registry for the real connector key and listed across all folders.

`registry list` returns three buckets in `Data`: `ExtensionTypes` (the OOTB
extension types, always available), `Connectors` and `Processes` (only after
`uip login`). Each extension-type row carries `ExtensionType`, `Label`,
`BpmnElement` (the host BPMN element), `ExtensionTag`, and
`RequiresDiscovery` (`Yes` means you must resolve a concrete resource — process,
queue, connection — before the node is runnable).

In temp/smoke sandboxes, a CLI/tooling mismatch can produce valid JSON that is
only a failure envelope (for example `"Result": "Failure"`) instead of registry
content. For discovery-only tasks, keep that failed output in the transcript or
`registry-evidence/cli-error.txt`, then replace the final raw evidence JSON with
the matching entries from `validator/bpmn-spec.json`. The final saved evidence
must literally contain the requested extension type strings, such as
`Orchestrator.StartJob` and `Maestro.ReceiveMessageEvent`, not just the failure
envelope.

## 2. Get the template for each chosen type

```bash
uip maestro bpmn registry get <extensionType> --output json
```

`Data.ExtensionType` contains everything needed to author the node:

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `xmlTemplate` | The literal node XML with `{placeholder}` slots. **Author from this; fill placeholders only.** |
| `bpmnElement` | The host BPMN element the template uses (for source files, normalize to lower-camel such as `bpmn:serviceTask`). |
| `extensionTag` | `uipath:activity`, `uipath:event`, or `uipath:mapping`. |
| `contextFields[]` | The `uipath:context` inputs; each may carry its own `bindingInfo`. |
| `bindingInfo` | How the node binds to a resource (see §4). |
| `inputPattern` / `inputName` / `inputTarget` | How the request body input is shaped. |
| `requiresDiscovery` / `isDynamic` | Whether a concrete resource must be resolved first. |

The placeholders you fill are the obvious ones: `{id}`, `{name}`,
`{incomingEdge}`, `{outgoingEdge}`, `{varId}` (the output variable id), plus the
per-context-field placeholders (`{releaseKey}`, `{queueName}`, `{appId}`, …) and
the body CDATA. Leave the structural placeholders (`{incomingEdge}` /
`{outgoingEdge}`) wired to the sequence-flow ids you create in
[structural-bpmn.md](structural-bpmn.md).

## 3. Connector (`Intsvc.*`) enrichment

For connector types (`requiresDiscovery: Yes`, e.g.
`Intsvc.ActivityExecution`, `Intsvc.WaitForEvent`, `Intsvc.EventTrigger`),
resolve a live connection and object, then enrich:

```bash
uip is connections list --all-folders --output json   # pick a connection id + its connector (search all folders)
uip maestro bpmn registry get Intsvc.ActivityExecution \
    --connection-id <id> --object-name <object> --output json
```

The response adds an `ISEnrichment` block with the live field metadata. Write
the activity's `body` input (`target="body"`) and `context` (`connectorKey`,
`objectName`) from that enrichment — do not hand-author connector schemas. The
connection is referenced through a connection binding, `=bindings.<bindingId>`
(see §4).

## 4. Bindings — from `bindingInfo`, never invented

A node that targets a cloud resource carries a binding. The `bindingInfo` on the
extension type tells you the binding shape; the concrete value comes from
discovery or the user.

- **Resource bindings** (`bindingInfo.resource` = `process` / `queue` /
  `businessRule`): the context field named by `bindingInfo.contextField`
  (e.g. `releaseKey`, `queueName`) holds the resource key
  (`bindingInfo.propertyAttribute`, usually `Key`). Resolve the real key with
  `registry search` / discovered `Processes` / `Queues`; never guess a GUID.
- **Connection bindings** (`Intsvc.*`): the context references a connection via
  `=bindings.<bindingId>`, and a `<uipath:binding>` of `resource="Connection"`
  with `propertyAttribute="ConnectionId"` in the process-level
  `<uipath:bindings>` holds the live connection id from `uip is connections list`.

Declare all bindings in a single process-level `<uipath:bindings version="v1">`
block. Each `<uipath:binding>` carries `id`, `resource`, `propertyAttribute`,
and a `default` value (the resolved key/id).

## Agent wrapper selection — pick by `processType`, not the label

When a node invokes an agent, choose the wrapper by the resource's
**`processType`** (from `uip or processes list --all-fields`), not its display
label:

- Coded Python agents publish as `processType: "Function"` — use the
  `Orchestrator.StartJob` process contract, **not** `StartAgentJob`.
- Agent Builder (low-code) publishes as `processType: "Agent"` →
  `Orchestrator.StartAgentJob`.
- External A2A agent addressed by URL / skillId → `A2A.AgentExecution`.
- Integration Service external agent → `Intsvc.*AgentExecution`.

Gotcha: `A2A.AgentExecution` renders as an external A2A node and **disables the
Action dropdown** in Studio Web. Do not use it for a folder-deployed agent — the
canvas treats the task as misconfigured. Use `StartAgentJob`/`StartJob` for
folder-deployed resources.

## API workflow — wait vs fire-and-forget

Pick the wrapper by whether downstream needs the invocation result:
`Orchestrator.ExecuteApiWorkflow` **waits** for completion (result available to
later nodes); `Orchestrator.ExecuteApiWorkflowAsync` **returns immediately**
(fire-and-forget). Both are `bpmn:serviceTask` activities. Resolve `ReleaseKey`
(process GUID), `FolderKey`/`FolderPath`, and the request/response schemas before
the node is runnable — make the wait-versus-async choice explicit in the model.

When the caller asks for API workflow invocation/status/result fields, map those
fields as `uipath:output` rows on the API workflow `bpmn:serviceTask` itself
using the discovered output names/types and `source` expressions, for example
`source="=invocation"`, `source="=status"`, and `source="=result"` (or the exact
schema fields returned by discovery). Do not add a downstream script task solely
to split the API workflow service-task result into variables; that hides the
requested service-task output contract from the model.

## Integration Service triggers — bind trigger properties via the CLI

`Intsvc.TimerTrigger` and `Intsvc.EventTrigger` (and connector waits like
`Intsvc.WaitForEvent`) need their **trigger properties** enriched/bound through
the CLI — the same enrichment path as `Intsvc.*` activities (§3). A hand-authored
trigger shell stays **draft** until the CLI supplies the concrete trigger
properties, connection binding, and schemas.

## Connectionless vs connector HTTP

- **Connector activity** (`Intsvc.ActivityExecution` / a connector-authenticated
  operation): use when the call goes through a tenant connection, a dynamic
  connector schema, or a connector object operation. Keep the node **draft**
  until enriched. The CLI-owned enrichment blockers — the ones that must be
  resolved before upload or run, and that boundary notes should name explicitly
  — are **connection binding**, **dynamic schemas**, generated **package
  metadata** (`bindings_v2.json`, `entry-points.json`, `operate.json`,
  `package-descriptor.json`). Do not hand-author any of these (§3).
- **Connectionless / manual HTTP** (`Intsvc.HttpExecution`, or
  `Intsvc.UnifiedHttpRequest` when current tooling exposes the unified shape):
  use when the workflow itself owns the URL, method, payload, and response
  parsing (no connection). Author `mode="manual"`, `method`, `url`, `headers`,
  `parameters`, `body` directly from the registry template.

Status vocabulary for an IS node in a summary: **executable** (activity, inputs,
output variable, and downstream mappings present, runtime-verified if a run was
done), **draft** (BPMN shape/intent present but enrichment missing), **mock**
(returns fixed sample data instead of calling out), **blocked** (a required URL,
auth, schema, or enrichment decision is missing).

## 5. Assemble

1. Build the document scaffold and process (see
   [structural-bpmn.md](structural-bpmn.md)).
2. Declare root variables (`BPMN.Variables` template) and the
   `<uipath:bindings>` block.
3. For each node, paste its `registry get` `xmlTemplate`, fill placeholders, and
   wire `{incomingEdge}`/`{outgoingEdge}` to your sequence flows.
4. Author the structural BPMN the registry does not emit: sequence flows,
   gateway conditions/defaults, event definitions, boundary events,
   subprocess/call-activity containers, multi-instance markers.
5. Generate the `bpmndi:BPMNDiagram` (shape per node, edge per flow).
6. Validate (see [structural-bpmn.md#validation](structural-bpmn.md#validation)).

## OOTB extension types (29, login-free)

These are the built-in types `registry pull` returns without login. Discover the
exact template for any of them with `registry get <type>`.

| Extension type | Host element | Tag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Actions.HITL` | `bpmn:userTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.StartJob` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.StartAgentJob` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.BusinessRules` | `bpmn:businessRuleTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.ExecuteApiWorkflowAsync` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.CreateQueueItem` | `bpmn:sendTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.CreateAndWaitForQueueItem` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.StartAgenticProcess[Async]` | `bpmn:callActivity` | activity |
| `Orchestrator.StartCaseMgmtProcess[Async]` | `bpmn:callActivity` | activity |
| `Intsvc.ActivityExecution` | `bpmn:sendTask` | activity |
| `Intsvc.HttpExecution` / `Intsvc.UnifiedHttpRequest` | `bpmn:sendTask` | activity |
| `Intsvc.WaitForEvent` | `bpmn:receiveTask` | event |
| `Intsvc.EventTrigger` | `bpmn:startEvent` | event |
| `Intsvc.TimerTrigger` | `bpmn:startEvent` | activity |
| `Intsvc.{Async,SyncAgent,AsyncAgent,SyncWorkflow,AsyncWorkflow}Execution` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `A2A.AgentExecution` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |
| `BPMN.Variables` | `bpmn:task` | mapping |
| `BPMN.ScriptTask` | `bpmn:scriptTask` | mapping |
| `Maestro.ReceiveMessageEvent` | `bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent` | event |
| `Maestro.SendMessageEvent` | `bpmn:intermediateThrowEvent` | event |
| `Maestro.CaseRulesEvaluator` / `Maestro.CaseManagerGuardrails` | `bpmn:serviceTask` | activity |

This table is a discovery aid, not a substitute for `registry get` — always pull
the live template before authoring.

If a registry `xmlTemplate` returns a PascalCase BPMN host tag such as
`bpmn:SendTask` or `bpmn:ReceiveTask`, normalize only the BPMN host element
names to the serializer's lower-camel form (`bpmn:sendTask`,
`bpmn:receiveTask`) when inserting it into a source file. Keep the
`uipath:*` payload and its `uipath:type` value unchanged.

Event types stay event-wrapped even when you place them on task-like BPMN
hosts: `Intsvc.WaitForEvent`, `Intsvc.EventTrigger`,
`Maestro.ReceiveMessageEvent`, and `Maestro.SendMessageEvent` use
`uipath:event`, not `uipath:activity`.
