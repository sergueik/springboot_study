# Expression Authoring

Use this reference whenever pass 2 writes Maestro runtime expressions in BPMN
XML. Pass 1 may use business-readable placeholder conditions; pass 2 replaces
them with expressions only after the variables and scopes exist.

## Stored expression shape

- Use a leading `=` where Maestro expects expression content.
- Treat values without `=` as literals.
- Read BPMN variables through `vars.<variableId>`, for example
  `=vars.Var_RequestId`.
- Do not use bare variable names such as `=requestId` in generated runtime XML.
- Context bindings use `=bindings.<bindingId>`.
- Current element outputs use `result` only in output mappings for that
  element. For new BPMN script tasks, return an object and expose its value
  through `result.response`: use `return { response: value };` with
  `source="=result.response"` for a scalar variable, or return a nested object
  and use `source="=result.response.<field>"` for a field. Do not use
  `source="=result"` with a bare scalar return in live debug/runtime BPMN; the
  run can complete while the mapped variable reads back empty.
- Multi-instance task bodies read the current item from `iterator.item`.
- Multi-instance subprocess bodies read the current item from
  `iterator[0].item`. Use `iterator[1].item` (and so on) inside nested
  multi-instance subprocesses: the index counts nesting depth from outermost
  (`[0]`) to innermost.
- The current 0-based loop index inside any multi-instance body is exposed as
  `iterator.loopCounter` for tasks and `iterator[N].loopCounter` for
  subprocesses at depth N.
- Error mapping conditions may inspect the built-in error object through
  `vars.error`, for example `=vars.error.code == "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"`.

## Inline JavaScript with `=js:`

When a mapping body or context value needs computation that a simple
`=vars.<id>` expression cannot express, prefix the body with `=js:` and follow
it with a JavaScript expression. The runtime evaluates the rest of the value
against the same `vars`, `bindings`, `result`, and `iterator` namespaces.
Use this form inside CDATA mapping bodies; it is the runtime-supported
escape hatch the BPMN expression grammar does not otherwise expose.

```xml
<uipath:input name="JobArguments" type="json" target="bodyField"><![CDATA[
{"startRow":"=js:iterator[0].loopCounter * vars.Var_RowsPerShard",
 "endRow":"=js:(iterator[0].loopCounter + 1) * vars.Var_RowsPerShard - 1"}
]]></uipath:input>
```

Rules:

- The prefix is `=js:` (case-sensitive, no space).
- The body must still satisfy lint-sensitive constraints: no assignment
  operators in fields where read-only expressions are required.
- Prefer plain `=vars.<id>` or `=bindings.<id>` when the value does not need
  computation — `=js:` should be reserved for arithmetic, string
  manipulation, or conditional selection.
- A `=js:` expression that returns an object or array must produce valid JSON
  for fields typed `json`.

Prefer JavaScript-safe variable ids such as `Var_RequestId`. If a brownfield
file contains non-identifier ids, preserve them and let the product editor or
CLI normalize the access form; do not silently rename variables without updating
all mappings, expressions, and generated metadata.

## Lint-sensitive fields

These fields must be read-only expressions:

- Gateway `bpmn:conditionExpression` values.
- Activity skip conditions.
- Multi-instance completion and filter conditions.
- `uipath:errorMapping` condition values.
- Mapping values that read variables or element outputs.

Do not use assignment operators in these fields. Comparisons such as `==`,
`===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>=`, and `<=` are allowed.

## Scope and availability

- Root variables are visible across the root process after they are declared and
  reachable by control flow.
- An output variable you intend to expose in runtime inspection (via
  `debug-instance variables-all` or `instance variables`) must be root-scoped —
  declare its `uipath:output` or `uipath:inputOutput` WITHOUT an `elementId`. A
  variable scoped with `elementId` is bound to that element and is not surfaced
  as a root/global runtime variable. Preserve exact variable ids: if the
  requested variable id is `product`, declare `id="product"` and map to
  `var="product"`, not `Product` or `Var_Product`. Current BPMN live debug may
  expose the root output definition while still returning the value as `null`;
  treat that as a runtime/debug API limitation, not proof that the authored
  mapping is absent.
- Subprocess variables stay scoped to that subprocess.
- Output mappings should target `uipath:inputOutput` or `uipath:output`
  variables, not read-only `uipath:input` variables.
- Entry point inputs that must later be updated need a separate mutable
  `uipath:inputOutput` variable and an explicit mapping from the entry input.
- Trigger-bound values are commonly represented as `uipath:inputOutput`
  variables scoped with `elementId` so the trigger can write them during
  execution.

## Common mistakes

- `=requestId` instead of `=vars.Var_RequestId`.
- `var="requestId"` instead of `var="Var_RequestId"`.
- Using `result` outside the output mapping of the element that produced it.
- Reading `iterator[0].item` outside the multi-instance subprocess body.
- Moving a variable into a subprocess without updating mappings that read it
  from the root scope.
