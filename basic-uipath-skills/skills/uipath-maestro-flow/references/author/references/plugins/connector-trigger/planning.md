# Connector Trigger Nodes — Planning

Connector trigger nodes start a flow when an external event fires (e.g., "email received in Outlook", "issue created in Jira"). They use UiPath Integration Service connectors — the same ecosystem as IS activity nodes — but replace the manual/scheduled start node with an event-driven one.

> **Two node families, same mechanism:**
>
> - **Connector trigger** (`uipath.connector.trigger.<key>.<trigger>`) — **starts** the flow.
> - **Wait for events** (`uipath.connector.event.<key>.<event>`) — **pauses a running flow** until the event arrives, then continues. Has an `input` port; NOT the start node. See [Wait for events](impl.md#wait-for-events-uipathconnectoreventkeyevent).

## When to Use

**Trigger** — flow should start when an external event fires.

**Event** (mid-flow) — running flow must wait for an external event before proceeding (sent an approval, waits for the reply). Flow keeps its own start trigger.

### Decision Order

| Tier | Trigger Type | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IS connector trigger** (this node type) | A connector exists and supports the event you need (e.g., "new email", "issue created") |
| 2 | **Scheduled trigger** (`core.trigger.scheduled`) | No event trigger exists, but you can poll on a schedule + filter for changes |
| 3 | **Manual trigger** (`core.trigger.manual`) | Flow is started on demand by a user or API call |

### Prerequisites

- `uip login` required — trigger nodes only appear in the registry after authentication
- A healthy IS connection must exist for the connector. Before concluding none exists: derive the connector key from a `registry search` node type (never inferred from the service's brand name — the registry key is frequently prefixed or qualified differently), list with `uip is connections list "<connector-key>" --all-folders --output json`, and retry once with `--refresh`. An empty result from an unverified key or without `--all-folders` is a false negative, not "no connection." Only when absence is confirmed must the user create one before proceeding.
- `uip maestro flow registry pull` must be run to cache trigger node types locally

### When NOT to Use

- **No connector exists for the service** — use a scheduled trigger with `core.action.http.v2` polling instead
- **The event is time-based, not data-driven** — use `core.trigger.scheduled`
- **The flow should be started manually** — use `core.trigger.manual`
- **You need to react to UiPath Orchestrator queue items** — use a queue trigger (separate mechanism)

## Node Type Pattern

`uipath.connector.trigger.<connector-key>.<trigger-name>`

Examples:
- `uipath.connector.trigger.uipath-microsoft-outlook365.email-received`
- `uipath.connector.trigger.uipath-atlassian-jira.issue-created`
- `uipath.connector.trigger.uipath-salesforce-slack.new-message`

## Key Differences from IS Activity Nodes

| Aspect | IS Activity | IS Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Type pattern | `uipath.connector.<key>.<activity>` | `uipath.connector.trigger.<key>.<trigger>` |
| Position in flow | Anywhere (action node) | Start node only (replaces manual trigger) |
| `--connection-id` on `registry get` | Optional (enriches metadata) | **Required** (fails without it) |
| Metadata returned | `inputDefinition`, `outputResponseDefinition`, `connectorMethodInfo` | `eventParameters`, `filterFields`, `outputResponseDefinition`, `eventMode` |
| Configuration | `node configure --detail` (method, endpoint, bodyParameters) | `node configure --detail` (eventMode, eventParameters, filter tree; objectName for generic triggers) |
| Bindings | `Connection` resource | `Connection` + `EventTrigger` + `Property` resources (auto-generated) |

## Discovery

```bash
# Search for trigger nodes in the registry
uip maestro flow registry search trigger --output json

# Or search by service name
uip maestro flow registry search outlook trigger --output json
```

Confirm `tags` includes both `"connector"` and `"trigger"` in the results.

If the trigger doesn't appear, re-pull the registry (triggers require authentication):

```bash
uip login status --output json
uip maestro flow registry pull --force
```

## Ports

| Input Port | Output Port(s) |
|---|---|
| — (start node) | `output` |

## Output Variables

- `$vars.{nodeId}.output` — the event payload (structure depends on the trigger — see `outputResponseDefinition` from enrichment)
- `$vars.{nodeId}.error` — error details if the trigger encounters an issue

## Event Mode

Triggers operate in one of two modes (returned in `eventMode` from `registry get`):

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `webhooks` | The connector registers a webhook — events fire in near-real-time |
| `polling` | The runtime polls the service on an interval — slight delay between event and trigger |

The agent does not need to configure the mode — it is determined by the connector. Note it in the plan for the user's awareness.

> **Debug impact:** Only `polling` triggers can be debugged in Studio Web. `webhooks` triggers cannot be tested via `uip maestro flow debug` — they require deployment to Orchestrator. Flag this in the plan if the trigger uses webhook mode.

### Webhook Triggers — Extra Steps

When `eventMode` is `"webhooks"`, two additional considerations apply:

1. **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account) connections.** Some webhook events require BYOA — the customer must register their own OAuth app with the external service. The `byoaConnection` flag on the `triggers objects` response indicates this **per event object**, not per connector. Selection workflow (filter, `--refresh`, stop-and-ask) lives in [/uipath:uipath-platform — connections.md — For BYOA Connections](../../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/connections.md#for-byoa-connections-webhook-triggers). Flag in the plan if BYOA is required so the user can prepare.

2. **Webhook URL registration.** After the trigger is configured (Step 6 in implementation), the webhook URL must be retrieved and registered on the customer's external service. Without registration, the trigger never fires. See [implementation Step 6b](impl.md#step-6b--retrieve-and-display-webhook-url-webhooks-only) and [/uipath:uipath-platform — triggers.md — Webhook URL Retrieval](../../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/triggers.md#webhook-url-retrieval).

## Planning Annotation

In the architectural plan, annotate connector trigger nodes as:
- `trigger: <service-name>` with the intended event (e.g., "trigger: Outlook — email received")
- Record the event mode (`webhooks` or `polling`) if known from discovery
- If discovery found no trigger for the event, fall back to `core.trigger.scheduled` + polling or flag the gap in Open Questions
