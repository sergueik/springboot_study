# Transform Node — Planning

## Node Types

| Node Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `core.action.transform` | Chain multiple operations (filter, map, groupBy) in a single node |
| `core.action.transform.filter` | Filter an array based on conditions |
| `core.action.transform.map` | Transform each item (rename, convert fields) |
| `core.action.transform.group-by` | Group items by a field with aggregations |

## When to Use

Use Transform nodes for declarative map, filter, or group-by on a collection — no custom code needed.

### Selection Heuristics

| Situation | Use Transform? |
| --- | --- |
| Standard filter/map/group-by on an array | Yes |
| Custom logic, string manipulation, computation | No — use [Script](../script/planning.md) |
| Iterate and perform actions per item (API calls, etc.) | No — use [Loop](../loop/planning.md) |

## Ports

All transform variants share the same port layout:

| Input Port | Output Port(s) |
| --- | --- |
| `input` | `output`, `error` |

The `error` port is the implicit error port shared with all action nodes — see [Implicit error port on action nodes](../../../../shared/file-format.md#implicit-error-port-on-action-nodes).

## Output Variables

- `$vars.{nodeId}.output` — the transformed collection

## Key Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collection` | Yes | `$vars` reference to the input array |
| `operations` | Yes | Array of operation objects (filter, map, or groupBy) |

> The `collection` input accepts `$vars` references directly. Unlike condition expressions, the `=js:` prefix is optional — both `$vars.x` and `=js:$vars.x` work.

> **Filter `value` is literal-only.** `core.action.transform.filter`'s per-filter `value` field does NOT resolve `$vars.x`, `=js:`, or brace-template expressions — any such expression ships as a string literal and the filter silently returns an empty array. Only literal scalars work (`500`, `"active"`, `true`). If the threshold must be dynamic, move the filter into a [Script](../script/planning.md) node; keep Transform for static-threshold filters, maps, and group-by. See [impl.md](impl.md#filter-coreactiontransformfilter) for details.
