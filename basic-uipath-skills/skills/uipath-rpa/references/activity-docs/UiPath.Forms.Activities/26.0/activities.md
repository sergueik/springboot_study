| FormId | String | *(required)* | The form to display (selected in the designer) |
| InstanceName | String | `null` | Optional tag to distinguish multiple instances of the same form |
| IsAsync | Boolean | `true` | If true, the activity completes immediately; if false, blocks until the form is closed |
| Arguments | Dictionary | `{}` | Bindings between form field IDs and workflow variables |

### Usage Notes

- If a form with the same FormId and InstanceName is already open, the existing window is reused rather than opening a duplicate.
- In **sync mode**, Out and InOut arguments are updated when the form closes.
- In **async mode**, Out and InOut arguments bound to Global Variables update in real time as the user interacts with the form.
