### Logging & Debugging

Activities for debugging and diagnostics.

- **[GetLogTypes](activities/GetLogTypes.md)** - Gets all available log types for the current Appium session.
- **[GetLogs](activities/GetLogs.md)** - Retrieves logs of a specific type from the mobile device/Appium server.
- **[GetPageSource](activities/GetPageSource.md)** - Gets the XML page source of the current mobile screen for debugging UI hierarchy.

## Prerequisites

- **Appium Server** - An Appium server must be running and accessible. See [http://appium.io](http://appium.io) for installation instructions.
- **Mobile Device or Emulator** - A physical device (connected via USB/network) or emulator/simulator.
- **Platform-specific drivers**:
  - **Android**: UIAutomator2 driver (default)
  - **iOS**: XCUITest driver (requires macOS and Xcode)

## Common Workflow Pattern

All mobile automation workflows follow this pattern:

1. **Use MobileDeviceConnection scope** - All mobile activities must be inside this container
2. **Configure Appium capabilities** - Set platformName, deviceName, app path, etc.
3. **Perform mobile actions** - Use UI automation, device interaction, and app management activities
4. **Handle connection lifecycle** - The scope manages connection open/close automatically

## Example Workflow Structure

```xml
<ma:MobileDeviceConnection DisplayName="Mobile Device Connection"
                          AppiumUrl="http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub"
                          OutputConnection="[mobileDevice]">
  <ma:MobileDeviceConnection.Arguments>
    <scg:Dictionary x:TypeArguments="x:String, Argument">
      <InArgument x:TypeArguments="x:String" x:Key="platformName">Android</InArgument>
      <InArgument x:TypeArguments="x:String" x:Key="deviceName">Android Emulator</InArgument>
      <InArgument x:TypeArguments="x:String" x:Key="app">C:\apps\myapp.apk</InArgument>
    </scg:Dictionary>
  </ma:MobileDeviceConnection.Arguments>

  <ma:MobileDeviceConnection.Body>
    <!-- Your mobile automation activities here -->
    <ma:Tap Target="{maui:Target}" />
    <ma:SetText Target="{maui:Target}" Text="Hello Mobile" />
    <ma:GetText Target="{maui:Target}" Result="[textValue]" />
  </ma:MobileDeviceConnection.Body>
</ma:MobileDeviceConnection>
```

## Platform Support

Most activities work on both **Android** and **iOS**, but some features may be platform-specific:

- **DrawPattern** - Android only (pattern lock)
- **PressHardwareButton** - Some buttons are platform-specific (e.g., Android Back button)
- Appium capabilities and element selectors differ between platforms

## Notes

- **Namespace prefix**: Mobile Automation activities use the `ma:` XML namespace prefix in XAML
- **Appium version compatibility**: This package is compatible with Appium 1.x and 2.x servers
- **Target resolution**: Mobile UI elements are typically targeted using descriptors generated by the UiPath Mobile Device Manager
- **Computer Vision support**: Activities support CV-based targeting as an alternative to native element selectors
- **Resource keys**: Some activity display names in the generated docs show resource keys (e.g., "ActivityNameXxx") instead of friendly names. Refer to UiPath Studio's activity panel for correct display names.
