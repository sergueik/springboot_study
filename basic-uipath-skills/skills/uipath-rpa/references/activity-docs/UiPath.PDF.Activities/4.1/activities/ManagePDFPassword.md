# Manage PDF Password

`UiPath.PDF.Activities.PDF.ManagePDFPassword`

Sets, changes, or removes the user and/or owner password on a PDF file. At least one password field must be provided. The activity writes the resulting file to the path specified by `OutputFileName` (or a generated default path) and returns it as an `ILocalResource` via `OutputFile`.

**Package:** `UiPath.PDF.Activities`
**Category:** App Integration > PDF

## Properties

### Input

| Name | Display Name | Kind | Type | Required | Default | Placeholder | Description |

_No configuration properties._

| Name | Display Name | Type | Description |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| `OutputFile` | Output File | `ILocalResource` | The resulting modified PDF file as a local resource. |

## Notes

- `FileName` and `ResourceFile` are mutually exclusive (`[OverloadGroup]`). Provide exactly one.
- At least one of the four password arguments (`OldUserPassword`, `NewUserPassword`, `OldOwnerPassword`, `NewOwnerPassword`) must be set; providing none is a validation error.
- The user password and owner password must not be identical.
- If the file is protected with a user password, either `OldUserPassword` or `OldOwnerPassword` must be supplied to open it.
- Owner rights are required to change passwords. If the supplied password does not grant owner rights, the activity throws.
