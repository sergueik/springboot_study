### CI/CD Activity Hierarchy

```
ContinuableAsyncCodeActivity
└── CicdBaseActivity                          # ContinueOnError + TimeoutMS (60 s default)
    ├── Clone, Analyze, Build                 # No Orchestrator client; delegate to PipelinesWrapper
    └── CicdBaseOrchestratorPackageActivity   # Adds Tenant + OrchestratorClient
        ├── PublishPackage, UpdateProcess, DownloadPackage
        └── BaseTestingActivity (persistent)
            ├── RunTests
            └── RunExistingTestSet
```

### Solutions Activity Hierarchy

```
ContinuableAsyncCodeActivity
└── BaseSolutionsActivity                     # Tenant (required), ContinueOnError, TimeoutMS (120 s default)
    └── All 9 Solutions activities
```
