## Valid Configurations

The properties shown in the designer depend on the selected `Frequency` value:

### Hourly

Set `Frequency` to `Hourly`. Configure:
- `HourlyRepeat` — run every N hours.
- `HourlyStartingMinutes` — minutes past the hour when the trigger fires.

### Daily

Set `Frequency` to `Daily`. Configure:
- `DailyRepeat` — run every N days.
- `DailyStartingTime` — time of day (hour and minute) at which to fire.

### Weekly

Set `Frequency` to `Weekly`. Configure:
- `WeeklyDaysToRunOn` — which days of the week to fire.
- `WeeklyStartingTime` — time of day at which to fire on those days.

### Monthly

Set `Frequency` to `Monthly`. Configure:
- `MonthlyRepeat` — run every N months.
- `MonthDaySelection` — choose between specific calendar days (`DaysOfMonthToRunOn`) or a weekday-of-month pattern (`MonthlyDaysToRunOn`).
- `MonthlyStartingTime` — time of day at which to fire.

### Minute By Minute

Set `Frequency` to `MinuteByMinute`. Configure:
- `MinuteByMinuteRepeat` — run every N minutes.

### Cron Expression

Set `Frequency` to `CronExpression`. Configure:
- `CronExpression` — a Quartz-style seven-field cron string (seconds, minutes, hours, day-of-month, month, day-of-week, year).
- `TriggerEveryPlaceHolder` is displayed as a read-only hint when `Frequency` is `Weekly` or `CronExpression`.

### Enum Reference

**`TimeFrequency`**

| Value | Description |

| `Daily` | Trigger every N days at a specified time |
| `Weekly` | Trigger on specified days of the week |
| `Monthly` | Trigger on specified days of the month |
| `MinuteByMinute` | Trigger every N minutes |
| `CronExpression` | Trigger according to a Quartz cron expression |

**`MonthDaySelectionType`**

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `DayOfMonth` | Trigger on specific numbered days of the month |
| `DayOfWeek` | Trigger on a named weekday occurrence within the month |

## XAML Example

```xml
<!-- Daily at 09:00, every weekday -->
<ui:TimeTrigger
    xmlns:ui="clr-namespace:UiPath.Core.Activities;assembly=UiPath.System.Activities"
    DisplayName="Time Trigger"
    Frequency="Daily"
    DailyRepeat="1"
    DailyStartingTime="[New DateTime(2000,1,1,9,0,0)]"
    TimeZone="UTC"
    Result="{x:Reference jobInfo}" />
```

```xml
<!-- Cron expression: every weekday at noon -->
<ui:TimeTrigger
    xmlns:ui="clr-namespace:UiPath.Core.Activities;assembly=UiPath.System.Activities"
    DisplayName="Time Trigger"
    Frequency="CronExpression"
    CronExpression="0 0 12 ? * MON-FRI *"
    TimeZone="UTC"
    Result="{x:Reference jobInfo}" />
```

## Notes

- **Type: integration trigger.** `uip rpa activities find` returns `isTrigger: true, triggerType: "integration"` (Orchestrator-native subscription via the platform scheduler — no IS `ConnectionId` required, unlike Mail/GSuite/O365 integration triggers).
- **Placement: strict.** Place `Time Trigger` as the first activity in the workflow's root `Sequence`. Do **NOT** wrap in `ui:TriggerScope`. The handler — the work to execute on each scheduled firing — is the rest of the `Sequence` that follows. When the package is published to Orchestrator, this trigger is detected and a Time Trigger can be created from it.
- See [trigger-pattern-guide.md](../../../../trigger-pattern-guide.md) for the full placement contract.
- The `Result` output provides a `CurrentJobInfo` object usable in handler activities for runtime context.
- `TimeZone` accepts standard IANA time zone identifiers (e.g., `America/New_York`) or Windows time zone names (e.g., `Eastern Standard Time`).
- Cron expressions follow the Quartz scheduler format with seven fields. The default `"0 0 12 ? * MON-FRI *"` fires at 12:00 noon every weekday.
