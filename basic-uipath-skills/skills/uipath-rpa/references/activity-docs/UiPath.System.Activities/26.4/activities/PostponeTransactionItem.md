## XAML Example

```xml
<ui:PostponeTransactionItem
    TransactionItem="[transactionItem]"
    DeferDate="[DateTime.Now.AddHours(2)]"
    DueDate="[DateTime.Now.AddDays(1)]"
    xmlns:ui="clr-namespace:UiPath.Core.Activities;assembly=UiPath.System.Activities" />
```

## Notes

- Requires an active Orchestrator connection. The robot must be connected to Orchestrator at runtime.
- The `TransactionItem` must have status **In Progress**. This activity is typically called when a transient condition prevents immediate processing (for example, a downstream system is temporarily unavailable).
- After being postponed, the item's status is changed back to **New** in Orchestrator with the specified scheduling window applied. It will not be picked up again until after `DeferDate`.
- `DeferDate` is required. `DueDate` is optional but recommended to prevent indefinite deferral.
