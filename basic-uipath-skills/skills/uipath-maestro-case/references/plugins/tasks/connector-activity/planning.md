# connector-activity task — Planning

A connector activity task inside a stage. Calls an external service (Jira, Slack, Salesforce, Gmail, etc.) via UiPath Integration Service.

This plugin is **schema-data-driven** — one plugin covers every connector. Connector-specific input shapes are discovered from the `case spec` CLI's normalized output, not baked into this plugin.

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md describes a task as `CONNECTOR_ACTIVITY` or names a specific external service action (e.g., "send a Slack message", "create a Jira issue", "update Salesforce opportunity").

For **connector-based triggers** inside a stage (wait for an external event), use [connector-trigger](../connector-trigger/planning.md).

For **case-level event triggers** (outside any stage), use [`plugins/triggers/event/`](../../triggers/event/planning.md).

## Resolution Pipeline

Run these steps during planning. Each step feeds into the `tasks.md` entry.

### 1. Find the connector in TypeCache

If `~/.uip/case-resources/typecache-activities-index.json` does not exist, run `uip maestro case registry pull` first (missing file is a precondition failure, not a 0-match — Rule 17 gate does not apply). If still missing after pull, the tenant has no connector activities — emit placeholder per § Unresolved Fallback below.

Read `~/.uip/case-resources/typecache-activities-index.json` directly. Match on `displayName` or `connectorKey` + operation description from sdd.md. Record `uiPathActivityTypeId`.

**No match (Scenario A — connector not found).** A 0-match inside the existing cache is gated by Rule 17 — run the [registry-discovery.md § MUST Confirm Before Placeholder Fallback](../../../registry-discovery.md#must-confirm-before-placeholder-fallback) AskUserQuestion (`Force pull` / `Use placeholders for all`) for the lookup batch before any fallback. Only after the user picks `Use placeholders for all`: mark `type-id` `<UNRESOLVED: no typecache activity for <query>>`, skip § 2 (no `activity-type-id` to pass to `get-connection`), and fall through to § Unresolved Fallback (placeholder task, `data: {}`). Continue planning — do not halt ([planning.md § 3.4](../../../planning.md)).

### 2. Resolve the connection

```bash
uip maestro case registry get-connection \
  --type typecache-activities \
  --activity-type-id "<uiPathActivityTypeId>" --output json
```

Returns `Entry`, `Config`, and `Connections`. If the sdd.md names a connection, match it by `name` and use it directly. Otherwise **always present the choice via AskUserQuestion — do not auto-select**, even when one connection exists:

- **`Connections` non-empty** → list connections by `name` **plus a "Create a new connection" option**.
- **`Connections` empty** → offer **Create a new connection** / **Skip (defer)**.
- **Create chosen** → create it (background `is connections create`, capture `ConnectionId`), then continue with the new id. Procedure: [connector-integration.md § Creating a Connection](../../../connector-integration.md#creating-a-connection).
- **Skip / create fails** → mark `<UNRESOLVED: no IS connection for <connectorKey>>` and omit `input-values:` ([§ Unresolved Fallback](#unresolved-fallback)).

Record `connection-id`, `connector-key`, `object-name` from the response (or from the create output).

Connection selection mechanics (`--refresh` retry, ping verification, BYOA workflow, connection creation): see [/uipath:uipath-platform — connections.md](../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/connections.md).

### 3. Discover the operation contract via `case spec`

One CLI call replaces the legacy `case tasks describe` + `is resources describe` dance:

```bash
uip maestro case spec --type activity \
  --activity-type-id "<uiPathActivityTypeId>" \
  --connection-id "<connection-id>" \
  --skip-case-shape \
  --output json
```

`--skip-case-shape` returns a leaner response (no `caseShape`) — the right size for planning. Phase 3 re-runs the same command without the flag, plus `--input-details`, to mint the populated `caseShape`. See [`case-spec-input-details.md`](../../../case-spec-input-details.md) for the full `--input-details` JSON contract.

> **Synthetic HTTP request branch.** When `spec.identity.objectName` is `"httpRequest"` or `"http-request"`, the activity is the synthetic generic-HTTP path — `bodyParameters` is rejected (no curated body schema). Pass HTTP body via `queryParameters` instead, or omit. Spec output reflects this in `inputs.bodyFields = []`.

The response carries everything the planning phase needs:

| Spec output | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `inputs.bodyFields[]` | Body request fields with `name` (dotted), `dataType`, `required`, `description`, optional `defaultValue` / `enum` / `reference` |
| `inputs.pathParameters[]`, `inputs.queryParameters[]` | URL-template substitutions and query-string params with the same per-field shape |
| `inputs.multipart` | `null` for non-multipart; otherwise `{ bodyFieldName, parameters[] }` — multipart upload contract |
| `outputs.responseFields[]` | Response shape; `[?responseCurated]` are FE-broken-out outputs, `[?primaryKey]` are id fields |
| `outputs.pagination` | `null` for non-list, `{ maxPageSize: N }` for list operations |
| `filter` | `undefined` when the activity does NOT support server-side filtering. Present when it does, with `builder: "ceql"` and `fields[]` listing every searchable field |
| `references[]` | Cross-references (lookups). Each entry includes a pre-built `discoverCommand` runnable string |
| `diagnostics.fetched` / `fallbacks` | What endpoints succeeded / fell back; surface `fallbacks` to the user when meaningful |

### 4. Resolve reference fields

Check `inputs.{bodyFields, pathParameters, queryParameters}` for entries with a `reference` object. Each carries a pre-built `discoverCommand`:

```jsonc
"reference": {
    "objectName": "MailFolder",
    "lookupValue": "id",
    "lookupNames": ["displayName"],
    "discoverCommand": "uip is resources run list uipath-microsoft-outlook365 MailFolder --connection-id <id>"
}
```

Run the `discoverCommand` exactly as given. Match the sdd.md value to `lookupNames[0]` in the results. Use the resolved `lookupValue` (the id) in `input-values`.

> **Reference IDs are connection-scoped.** Resolve every reference field freshly against the current `--connection-id`, immediately before writing tasks.md. Never reuse an ID resolved against a different connection — silent runtime fault. Full mechanism: [/uipath:uipath-platform — reference-resolution.md § Reference IDs Are Connection-Scoped (CRITICAL)](../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/reference-resolution.md#reference-ids-are-connection-scoped-critical).

> **Paginate when looking up by name.** `run list` returns one page (up to 1000 items); check `Data.Pagination.HasMore` + `Data.Pagination.NextPageToken`. Re-run with `--query "nextPage=<NextPageToken>"` until found or `HasMore` is `"false"`. Short-circuit on first match.

If a reference cannot be resolved, **AskUserQuestion** with the candidates (dropdown when finite set, plus "Something else"). Do not guess.

### 5. Validate required fields (HARD GATE)

This is a hard gate — do NOT proceed to writing tasks.md until every required field has a value.

1. Collect every `inputs.*[?required]` entry from the spec output (across `bodyFields`, `pathParameters`, `queryParameters`).
2. For each, check whether sdd.md names a value (literal, variable reference, or cross-task output).
3. If missing and no `defaultValue`, **AskUserQuestion** — list the missing fields with their `displayName` and what kind of value is expected.
4. Free-form input is appropriate when the value space is open-ended (channel names, message bodies, IDs); when a finite set of sensible values exists (e.g. an `enum`), present them via AskUserQuestion per the dropdown rule in [SKILL.md](../../../../SKILL.md).
5. Only after all required fields have values, proceed to step 6.

> **Do NOT guess or skip missing required fields.** A missing required field will cause a runtime error. It is always better to ask than to assume.

### 6. Map SDD inputs to connector fields

SDD input names rarely match connector field names exactly. Match each SDD input to a `bodyFields`/`pathParameters`/`queryParameters` entry by comparing the SDD field name against the `displayName` (or `name`) from Step 3.

An SDD input that matches `spec.inputs.*` remains a normal Step 6 input even when its name is literally `filter`: include it in `input-values`; Step 7 applies only when the SDD separately requests a structured filter tree and `spec.filter` supports one.

For each required field in spec.inputs.*, there must be a matching SDD input. If a required field has no match, **AskUserQuestion** — never leave required fields unmapped.

Values can be:
- **Static literals** — `"Payment__c"`, `"Text"`, `42`
- **Resolved reference IDs** — from Step 4
- **Case variable references** — `=vars.X` (impl wraps as `=js:(vars.X)` for the connector body sink before passing to the CLI)
- **Metadata references** — `=metadata.X` (impl wraps as `=js:(metadata.X)`)
- **Pre-wrapped operator expressions** — `=js:(vars.amount > 5000)` (already canonical — pass-through)
- **Cross-task refs** — `<- "Stage"."Task".output` (impl resolves through the common [output-reference-ID algorithm](../../variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#output-reference-id-authoritative) to `=vars.<outputReferenceId>`, then wraps)

> **tasks.md carries SDD-natural form.** The implementation step (Step 9.7 of connector-activity impl) rewrites every reference to its canonical sink form when constructing `--input-details`. Connector body sinks use `=js:(<expr>)`. Full rule: [bindings-and-expressions.md § Canonical form per sink](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md#canonical-form-per-sink).

### 7. Optional — author a server-side filter

If `spec.filter` is present (i.e. the operation declares a `FilterBuilder` parameter and supports CEQL), the user can author a filter tree. If `spec.filter` is `undefined`, server-side filtering is not supported on this operation — filter downstream (post-execution) instead.

Filter tree shape, operator table, anti-patterns, worked examples: [/uipath:uipath-platform — Filter Trees (CEQL)](../../../../../uipath-platform/references/integration-service/activities.md#filter-trees-ceql). Same shape applies to triggers (compiler differs — JMESPath instead of CEQL).

The filter tree goes into `tasks.md` under `filter:` as a literal JSON object — Phase 3 passes it to `case spec --input-details`. Do NOT pass a raw CEQL string under `queryParameters.where` (or whichever connector-specific name) when authoring a filter — case-tool rejects this at configure time, and the round-trip from Studio Web breaks.

### 8. Build input-values

Using the mapped fields from Step 6, build the `input-values` JSON with dot-path field names from `inputs.bodyFields[].name`:

```json
{
    "bodyParameters": {"message.toRecipients": "=vars.managerEmail", "message.subject": "=vars.caseId", "message.body.content": "=vars.description", "message.body.contentType": "Text"},
    "queryParameters": {"limit": 50},
    "pathParameters":  {"id": "AAMkAGI..."}
}
```

Dotted keys (`message.body.content`) get nested into structured objects via `nestDottedKeys` at Phase 3 mint time — the planner just records the dotted form.

#### Array-of-object body fields — SDD authors business shape; planner translates to wire shape

When `inputs.bodyFields[].name` contains `[*]` (e.g. `toRecipients[*].emailAddress.address`, `attachments[*]`, `blocks[*].text`), the `[*]` is **schema notation** meaning "array of" — borrowed from JSONPath. The SDD describes the input at a **business level**; the planner translates to wire shape using the spec's flat field-name metadata.

**Translation algorithm.** Group spec body fields by parent (the prefix before `[*]`). For each parent:

| Spec — fields with `[*]` for this parent | SDD value form | Planner output (wire shape into `tasks.md input-values.bodyParameters[<parent>]`) |
|---|---|---|
| Exactly one sub-field `<parent>[*].<leaf>` of `dataType: <T>` | List of scalars matching `<T>` (e.g. `["a@x", "b@y"]`) | `[nestUnder(<leaf>, v) for v in sdd_value]` — each scalar becomes `{<leaf nested>: v}` |
| One or more sub-fields | List of objects already matching the element shape (e.g. `[{"emailAddress":{"address":"a@x"}}]`) | Pass through unchanged |
| Two or more sub-fields under the same parent | List of scalars | **Halt + AskUserQuestion** — scalars are ambiguous (which sub-field?). Ask user for object list. |
| Any | Single scalar (not a list) | **Halt + AskUserQuestion** — confirm whether user meant single-element list |

**Worked example — Outlook `Message`:**

Spec exposes `toRecipients[*].emailAddress.address` (one sub-field, dataType `string`) and `bccRecipients[*].emailAddress.address` (same shape). SDD:

```
| toRecipients  | Array of string | ["a@x"]           |
| bccRecipients | Array of string | ["b@x", "c@x"]    |
```

Planner emits to `tasks.md input-values.bodyParameters`:

```json
{
    "toRecipients":  [{"emailAddress":{"address":"a@x"}}],
    "bccRecipients": [{"emailAddress":{"address":"b@x"}}, {"emailAddress":{"address":"c@x"}}]
}
```

**Never** emit a key with literal `[*]` in `bodyParameters`. The CLI accepts it (well-formed JSON) and validate passes; runtime APIs (Microsoft Graph, Slack, etc.) reject with HTTP 400 `UnableToDeserializePostBody`. Pre-input scan in [`impl-json.md` § Step 1.b](impl-json.md#step-1b--array-of-object-body-fields-pre-input-scan-mandatory) halts on any literal `[*]` key.

## tasks.md Entry Format

Populate `outputs:` using the shared [I/O-binding output-list contract](../../variables/io-binding/planning.md#canonical-tasksmd-output-list).

```markdown
## T<n>: Add connector-activity task "<display-name>" to "<stage>"
- type-id: <uiPathActivityTypeId>
- connection-id: <connection-uuid>
- connector-key: <connectorKey>
- object-name: <objectName>
- input-values: {"bodyParameters":{...},"queryParameters":{...},"pathParameters":{...}}
- filter: {"groupOperator":"And","index":0,"uuId":null,"filters":[{"id":"Status","operator":"Equals","value":{"isLiteral":true,"rawString":"\"Active\"","value":"Active"},"uiId":null}]}
- outputs:                            # optional; omit only when the SDD declares none
  - <SDD output row, copied verbatim>
- isRequired: true
- runOnlyOnce: false
- activation-mode: <sequential|parallel|event-triggered|adhoc|fan-in|conditional-gate>   # required
- entry-rule: <runs-sequentially|current-stage-entered|wait-for-connector|adhoc|selected-tasks-completed>   # required; must pair with activation-mode — see ../../conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md
- order: after T<m>
- lane: <n>
- verify: tasks.md `input-values` covers every `inputs.*[?required]` from the lean spec across `bodyFields`, `queryParameters`, `pathParameters` — see Step 5 above.
```

`filter:` is optional and present only when the operation supports CEQL (i.e. `spec.filter` was non-null in step 7).

## Unresolved Fallback

Two entry paths: **Scenario A** — connector not found in TypeCache ([§ 1 No-match](#1-find-the-connector-in-typecache), after the Rule 17 gate); **Scenario B** — connector found but connection unresolved, only after the Step 2 create offer is **declined** or fails (or the run is non-interactive). When `Connections` is empty, offer to create one first (Step 2) — do not jump straight here.

> **Rule 17 exception.** Empty `Connections` from `get-connection` (the connector activity exists in typecache but no IS connection is registered) does NOT require the Rule 17 gate — proceed directly to placeholder.

If the connector or connection cannot be resolved:
- Mark `type-id` or `connection-id` with `<UNRESOLVED: reason>`
- Omit `input-values:` entirely — no schema to wire against
- Execution creates a placeholder task (display-name + type only) per [placeholder-tasks.md](../../../placeholder-tasks.md)
