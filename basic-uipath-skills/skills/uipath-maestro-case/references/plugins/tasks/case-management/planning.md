# case-management task — Planning

A nested case task. Invokes another case definition as a sub-case within the current one. Enables hierarchical / recursive case structures.

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md describes a task that spawns or delegates to another case definition. Typical patterns:

- Parent case orchestrates multiple sub-cases
- Long-running sub-workflow packaged as its own case

If sdd.md describes a simple stage-to-stage flow within the same case, do not use this — use regular stages wired by entry/exit conditions.

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `display-name` | sdd.md task name | Human-readable parent task label. |
| `name` | sdd.md `Child Case` | Concrete registry query and binding name; REQUIRED and never `<UNRESOLVED>`. Do not substitute `display-name`. |
| `folder-path` | Selected registry `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName` | Binds to `data.folderPath`; use the SDD `Folder Path` only as a concrete lookup hint. `<UNRESOLVED>` means name-only discovery. |
| `task-type-id` | Registry resolution (below) | `entityKey` in `caseManagement-index.json`; mirrors sdd.md `Resource Identity` when already resolved. |
| `inputs` | sdd.md task data mapping | Passed as case-instance inputs to the sub-case |
| `outputs` | sdd.md task Outputs + `tasks describe` schema | Follow the shared [I/O-binding output-list contract](../../variables/io-binding/planning.md#canonical-tasksmd-output-list). |
| `runOnlyOnce` | sdd.md (default `false`) | Re-entry behavior comes from the SDD, not the task type. |
| `isRequired` | sdd.md (default `true`) | |

## Registry Resolution

1. **Primary cache file:** `caseManagement-index.json`.
2. **Identifier field:** `entityKey`.
3. Match the exact concrete sdd.md `Child Case` name. Use sdd.md `Folder Path` only when concrete; `<UNRESOLVED>` means name-only discovery.
4. **`folder-path` = the SELECTED entry's `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName`**. Never substitute a parent folder or the parent task's display name.
5. Discover inputs/outputs via `tasks describe` — see [bindings-and-expressions.md § Discovering output names](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md).

Case-management lookups stay in `caseManagement-index.json` — never adopt a same-named process or other resource type. A missing child case is non-creatable and goes through the Rule-17 placeholder gate.

## Unresolved Fallback

Mark `<UNRESOLVED: case "<name>" in folder "<folder>" not found in caseManagement-index.json>`, using the preserved sdd.md `Child Case` name even when folder/identity are unresolved. Omit `inputs:` and `outputs:`; capture intended wiring in a fenced ```` ```text ```` code block (not `#` prefixed — it renders as markdown H1). Execution creates a placeholder task — see [placeholder-tasks.md](../../../placeholder-tasks.md). Note: if the referenced sub-case has not been deployed yet, it will not appear in the registry — the user must deploy it before the parent case can reference it.

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T<n>: Add case-management task "<display-name>" to "<stage>"
- taskTypeId: <entityKey>
- name: "<child-case-name>"
- folder-path: "<folder>"
- inputs:
  - <input_name> = "<value>"
- outputs:
  - <SDD output row, copied verbatim>
- runOnlyOnce: false
- isRequired: true
- activation-mode: <sequential|parallel|event-triggered|adhoc|fan-in|conditional-gate>   # required
- entry-rule: <runs-sequentially|current-stage-entered|wait-for-connector|adhoc|selected-tasks-completed>   # required; must pair with activation-mode — see ../../conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md
- order: after T<m>
- lane: <n>  # structural/layout position only; sequencing is the task entry rule plus data.tasks order.
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture TaskId
```
