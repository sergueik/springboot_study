|---|---|---|
| Pre-built connectors used instead of custom HTTP requests where available | Info | Check for HTTP Request activities that duplicate connector functionality |
| Connections use service accounts (not personal credentials) | Warning | Check connection authentication — service accounts preferred |
| Credentials rotated on regular schedule | Warning | Check credential expiration and rotation policy |
| Environment-specific connections configured (Dev/Test/Prod) | Warning | Verify connections point to correct environment endpoints |
| Only shared connections used (not individual) for agent-accessible tools | Warning | Check connection sharing settings |

### Trigger Configuration

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Event triggers filtered to relevant events only (not triggering on everything) | Warning | Check trigger event filter configuration |
| Triggered automations are idempotent (handle duplicate events safely) | Warning | Check for deduplication logic in triggered processes |
| Dead letter handling configured for failed trigger processing | Info | Check for error handling on trigger failures |
| Trigger firing rates monitored | Info | Check monitoring configuration |

## 12. Data Fabric

### Entity Design

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Entities model real business objects (Invoice, Customer, Order — not generic "Data") | Warning | Review entity names and field structure |
| Field types match the data they store (DateTime for dates, Decimal for money — not all String) | Warning | Check field type definitions |
| Relationships defined between related entities (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) | Info | Check for Reference fields connecting entities |

| Data retention policy defined (archival/cleanup of old records) | Info | Check data lifecycle management |
| Data Fabric used instead of Excel/CSV for shared cross-process data | Info | Check if Excel files are used where Data Fabric would be more appropriate |

## 13. Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

### Job Monitoring

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Alerts configured for job failures | Warning | Check Orchestrator alert settings |
| SLA monitoring configured for time-sensitive processes | Warning | Check SLA threshold configuration |
| Queue backlog alerts configured | Warning | Check queue monitoring thresholds |
| License exhaustion alerts configured | Info | Check license usage monitoring |
| Log forwarding configured to centralized SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Azure Monitor) | Info | Check log forwarding settings |

### Logging Strategy

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Log levels appropriate per environment (DEV=Trace, PROD=Info) | Warning | Check robot log level configuration |
| Custom business-level logs included (not just activity-level) | Info | Check for `Add Log Fields` and custom log messages |
| Sensitive data excluded from logs (PII, credentials) | Critical | Review log message content |

### Disaster Recovery

|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator configuration backed up | Warning | Check backup procedures |
| Rollback procedures documented and tested | Warning | Check disaster recovery documentation |
| High availability configured for critical deployments | Info | Check HA infrastructure |
| Runbooks documented for incident response | Info | Check operational runbooks |

## 14. Queue Operations Depth

### Queue Item SpecificData Size

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Queue item SpecificContent size < 1 MB (hard cap on Cloud, recommended cap on-prem) | Warning | Query queue items via API and check SpecificContent byte size. Grep workflow code for `Add Queue Item` where input is built from file reads, DataTable serialization, or Base64 encoding |
| Large payloads stored externally (Storage Bucket / DB) with only a reference in the queue item | Warning | Check queue item schemas for Base64 fields or large JSON blobs |

### Queue Priority Distribution

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Queue priorities are distributed (not >90% High priority) | Warning | Query queue items grouped by Priority — if everything is High, priority has no effect |
| SLA prediction awareness (SLA predictions auto-set items to High priority) | Info | Check if SLA predictions are enabled on the queue — if so, confirm this is intentional |

### Queue Retention

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Queue retention configured per volume (not relying on defaults for high-volume queues) | Warning | For queues with >1000 items/day, retention >30 days = database bloat. Check QueueItems row count |
| Queue retention policy explicitly documented per queue | Info | Check queue configuration |

## 15. Trigger / Schedule Antipatterns

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Time triggers not clustered on same cron minute (avoids job-creation spike) | Warning | Export all triggers, parse cron, flag >5 triggers firing within the same minute |
| Trigger auto-disable is monitored (Orchestrator disables trigger after 10 consecutive failures without success in 24h) | **Critical** | Check audit logs for "System Administrator deactivated trigger" events. Configure alert on trigger state changes |
| Event-driven work uses queue triggers / Integration Service triggers (not time-based polling) | Info | Triggers that start with "check for new items" and exit immediately are polling — prefer event-based |
| Queue trigger configuration appropriate (minimum items, max concurrent jobs) to avoid ghost job spawns | Info | Check trigger config: `Minimum items to trigger first job`, `Maximum pending and running jobs` |

## 16. Asset and Credential Operations

### Credential Rotation

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Credential expiry tracking in place (Orchestrator has no built-in expiry field) | **Critical** | Check for external credential store (CyberArk, Azure Key Vault) or companion tracking asset/documentation. AD password rotation (60-90 days) causes bot failure + account lockout if not tracked |
| Credential assets do NOT have name collisions across folders pointing to the same credential store entry | **Critical** | List credentials across folders via API; flag pairs where both Name and ExternalName match across different folders (password change in one silently changes all) |

### Asset Retrieval Efficiency

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| `Get Asset` / `Get Credential` NOT called in tight loops (use `CacheStrategy = Execution` if unavoidable) | Warning | Grep workflows for `GetAsset` / `GetCredential` inside `ForEach` / `While`. Each call = HTTP round-trip (hits rate limits on 10K+ item queues) |
| Per-robot asset values assigned for all production robots (not just dev robot) | Warning | For per-robot assets, verify values exist for every robot in the deployment folder |

## 17. Deployment and Publishing

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Production packages NOT published directly from Studio (CI/CD bypass) | **Critical** | Check Orchestrator audit logs for `Package.Create` events where source is Studio (not a CI/CD service account) |
| Production packages use `Strict` runtime rule (not `Lowest Applicable Version`) for core activity packages | Warning | Parse published `.nupkg` project.json → dependencies runtime rule. `Strict` for UiPath.System, UiPath.UIAutomation, etc. |
| Workflow Analyzer enforced before publish (governance policy) | Warning | Check Automation Ops Studio policy → "Require analysis before publish". Verify `project_analysis_results.json` is present in published `.nupkg` |

## 18. Robot / Machine Configuration

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple unattended robots NOT sharing the same Windows user credentials on same machine | **Critical** | Check robot-machine-user mappings. Windows Desktop only supports one interactive session; even on Windows Server, same user = session conflicts. `Kill Process` with default `AppliedTo=All` terminates across ALL user sessions |
| Machine template runtime reservations sized to actual peak concurrency (not oversized) | Warning | Compare allocated runtimes vs peak concurrent jobs per machine. Allocated > 2× peak = idle license waste that blocks other folders/processes |

## 19. Monitoring Infrastructure Health

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator webhooks monitored for circuit-breaker open state | **Critical** | Circuit breaker opens after repeated failures; events during outage are PERMANENTLY LOST (not retried). After 7 days >50% failure, webhook auto-disabled. Check audit logs for webhook state changes |
| Log forwarding change awareness (switching SQL ↔ Elasticsearch makes historical logs invisible in UI) | Warning | Check `Logs.RobotLogs.ReadTarget` config changes; only one destination is queried at a time — historical logs in the other store vanish from UI |

## 20. Security Boundaries

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Folders NOT relied on as hard security boundaries (cross-folder access is possible via `OrchestratorFolderPath` argument) | **Critical** | Grep project source for `OrchestratorFolderPath` / `FolderPath` arguments in Orchestrator activities. Any process referencing a folder outside its deployment folder = bypass potential. True isolation requires separate tenants |
| Integration Service connections scoped per environment (NOT shared across Dev/Test/Prod) | **Critical** | List IS connections by folder; flag same connection ID referenced from Dev and Prod folders. Dev runs could hit prod systems |
| Integration Service OAuth token expiry monitored (refresh tokens expire after 60 days of inactivity) | Warning | Check connection status via IS API. Look for `Status != Connected` or stale `lastAuthenticatedAt`. Expired refresh = silent 401s until manual re-auth |
