# Rule Catalog — Workflow (SKILL.md Step 2.5)

Step 2.5 of the review workflow. Runs **after** Step 2 (`uip agent refresh` then `uip agent validate` for low-code agents, plus related CLI validation) and **before** Step 3 (manual checklist review). Adds rule-ID-level findings to the report from two sources, in order:

1. **The review CLI** (`uip agent review` / `uip codedagent review`) — all deterministic static checks.
2. **The judgment catalog** (`agents-*-rules.md`) — checks that require the agent to read source and reason.

## Procedure

### 2.5a — Run the review CLI first

Mandatory even when the skill loads after another review pass already produced findings (SKILL.md Critical Rule 9).

Run the review command for the agent type, once, capturing JSON:

| Agent type | Command |
|---|---|
| Low-code (`agent.json`) | `uip agent review "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` |
| Coded (`main.py` + framework config) | `uip codedagent review "<PROJECT_DIR>" --output json` |

Parse the JSON. Findings live under `Data.Issues[]`; each issue is:

```json
{
  "RuleId": "LOWCODE_ENTRY_POINTS_MISSING",
  "Category": "schema",
  "Severity": "error",
  "Description": "...",
  "File": "entry-points.json",
  "SuggestedFix": "..."
}
```

The response also carries `Data.Verdict` (PASS/FAIL), `Data.Score`, `Data.Grade`, and `Data.Stats` — report the verdict/score if useful, but the `Issues[]` are the findings. `Data.Grade` is also consumed as **G_det**, the deterministic half of the Step 4.5 agent letter grade (read it from here, never recompute) — see [agents/agent-grading-rubric.md](agents/agent-grading-rubric.md). Carry each issue into the report **verbatim**; do not re-derive, rename, or re-rank. These `RuleId`s are authoritative as the CLI emits them and are **not** duplicated in the skill catalog.

If the review command is unavailable (CLI not installed, or a version without `agent review` / `codedagent review`), record one line in the report's "Rules Skipped" subsection with `reason: "uip agent review / codedagent review CLI not available"`, then continue with 2.5b.

### 2.5b — Apply the judgment catalog

1. **Identify which catalog files apply.** Use the detection table below.
2. **Read each catalog file in full.**
3. **Apply each rule's `detection_method`** (always the judgment form): read the named source material, reason about it, emit a finding when the criteria hold. Log the reasoning in the finding's `description`.
4. **Track skipped rules.** If a rule cannot apply (`status: deferred`, missing optional file, no eval set to assess against), record `rule_id` + reason for the report's "Rules Skipped" subsection. **Never silently skip.**
5. **Merge findings into the Step 5 report** under the "Rule Findings" subsection. Use the canonical line format:

   ```
   [<prefix><n>] `<rule_id>` — <file> — <description>. Fix: <suggested_fix>.
   ```

   where prefix is `C-D-` (Critical), `W-D-` (Warning), or `I-D-` (Info) per the severity mapping in [`rule-format.md`](rule-format.md).

## Detection table

Maps project signals to the judgment catalog files that must be loaded. Extend this table when adding new artifact types — do not edit SKILL.md.

| Signals present | Project type | Catalog files |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.json.type == "lowCode"` | Agent (low-code) | `agents/agents-lowcode-rules.md` (+ `agents/guardrails/guardrails-review.md` when `guardrails[]` is present or a guardrail use case matches — see Step 2.5b item 3) |
| Python coded-agent signals or `agent.json.type == "coded"` | Agent (coded) | `agents/agents-coded-rules.md` (+ `agents/guardrails/coded-guardrails-review.md` when the entry source wires SDK guardrails or a guardrail use case matches — see Step 2.5b item 3) |
| `pyproject.toml` + `main.py` + `uipath.json[functions]` only (no framework config) | Agent (coded — Simple Function) | same as Agent (coded) |
| `project.json` + `.xaml` / `.cs` | RPA | *(phase 2 — catalog not yet authored)* |
| `*.flow` + `project.uiproj` with `ProjectType: "Flow"` | Flow | *(phase 2)* |
| `.uipath/` or `app.config.json` | Coded App | *(phase 2)* |
| None of the above with no agent signal | unknown | Skip Step 2.5; flag in the report's "Notes" section that no catalog matched. |

## Why the split

Deterministic checks (file presence, schema walks, counts, set-membership, regex, run-artifact analysis) are faster and byte-reproducible in code, so they live in the review CLI — the agent does not re-implement them. The catalog carries only what code cannot decide reliably: prompt quality, tool-selection ambiguity, framework fit, semantic schema/eval mismatches, whole-program dataflow. Running the CLI first means the catalog never re-litigates a deterministic finding.

## Coexistence with manual checklists (Step 3)

- The CLI + judgment catalog cover what can be checked mechanically or with focused judgment. The checklists in `references/<type>/<type>-review-checklist.md` cover broader semantic / contextual checks (PDD alignment, business-logic correctness, architectural fit).
- Checklist rows that overlap with a rule are tagged like `*(rule: \`RULE_ID\`)*` — when reviewing, that rule (CLI or judgment) already covered it; do not re-flag.
- Findings from the CLI + judgment catalog appear in the "Rule Findings" subsection; findings from manual review use the Critical / Warning / Info sections.

## Determinism contract

Two consecutive runs over the same project produce identical findings *for the review-CLI checks*. Judgment-catalog rules are best-effort identical — the agent should reason from the same evidence in the same order, but minor wording variation in `description` is acceptable.

- Sort findings by (severity, category, rule_id, file, line) — never by discovery order.
- Do not include timestamps in finding text.
- Use relative paths from project root in finding `file` values; absolute paths in project metadata only.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Do not invent rule IDs.** If you observe a real issue covered by neither the review CLI nor the judgment catalog, surface it under the Critical / Warning / Info sections as a normal finding — do not promote it to a `rule_id`.
2. **Do not re-rank severities.** The CLI's `Severity` and the catalog's `severity` are authoritative for `error` / `warning` / `info`. For `judgment` rows, log the reasoning when picking the report band.
3. **Do not silently skip rules.** Every skip belongs in the report's "Rules Skipped" subsection with a reason.
4. **Do not run the catalog before the CLI.** Run `uip agent review` / `uip codedagent review` first (2.5a); for low-code agents, `uip agent refresh` and `uip agent validate` are assumed already completed in that order (Step 2) — so the judgment catalog focuses only on reasoning the CLI cannot do.
5. **Do not load catalog files outside the detection table.** Loading low-code rules against a non-agent project produces false positives.
6. **Do not re-implement deterministic checks inline.** Counts, regex, schema-presence, and set-membership are the review CLI's job. The skill itself ships no executable code.
