# UiPath Agents

## Hard Rules

- Treat "build/create/scaffold/implement a UiPath agent" as the full One-Prompt Flow by default. Do not stop after file creation or local run unless the user explicitly says to stop there.
- A normal completion point is after smoke eval and the mandatory Delivery fork question. A final build summary before that is premature unless run/eval is blocked or the user opted out.
- **Probe the `solution` verb once per session before the first scaffold or deploy.** Run `uip solution init --help --output json`. Result `Success` → use `solution init` and `solution deploy run --parent-folder-path` / `--parent-folder-key` (post-rename, default). `unknown command` / non-zero exit → CLI predates the rename; substitute `uip solution new <Name>` and `--folder-path` / `--folder-key` (same arguments otherwise) wherever this skill calls those.
- **Greenfield coded agents — scaffold with `uip codedagent new`, never hand-author the project.** Building a NEW coded agent from scratch: always create it with `uip codedagent new <name>`, then generate schemas with `uip codedagent init` — never hand-write `pyproject.toml` / `main.py` / `langgraph.json` / `entry-points.json` yourself, even for a trivial agent. Hand-authoring skips required project structure and produces invalid packages. (Existing or Studio Web local-workspace projects: do NOT run `uip codedagent new` — follow the project-state gating in [coded/quickstart.md](references/coded/quickstart.md).)
- **Coded agents only — bindings are always derived from UiPath Python SDK calls and must never be hand-authored.** To derive them, always run the sync workflow in [coded/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md](references/coded/lifecycle/bindings-reference.md) — scan code, regenerate `bindings.json`. Without this, resources cannot be overridden per execution environment and will always default to the hardcoded values in the SDK calls. Derive bindings whenever you add, remove, or modify any UiPath SDK resource call — for instance `assets`, `queues`, `processes`, `buckets`, `indexes`, `connections`, `apps`, `MCP servers`, or `InvokeProcess|CreateTask|CreateEscalation(...)`.

## Project Type Detection

Determine the agent mode before proceeding:

1. **First — confirm this is an agent, not a Coded Function.** If `uipath.json` declares a `functions` map (e.g. `"functions": {"main": "main.py:main"}`), the project is a **Python Coded Function**, not an agent. Stop here and use the [`uipath-functions`](/uipath:uipath-functions) skill instead. Functions are deterministic, do not reason via LLM, and have a distinct lifecycle (`uip function new/init/pack/publish/run`).
2. **Check for existing agent project files** in the working directory:
   - `pyproject.toml` + `.py` files + a framework dep (`uipath-langchain`, `uipath-llamaindex`, or `uipath-openai-agents`) → **Coded**. The framework package already declares `uipath` as a dependency, so an explicit `uipath` entry is not required.
   - `agent.json` with `"type": "lowCode"` + `project.uiproj`, AND no `pyproject.toml` → **Low-code**
3. **No existing project found** → ask the user:
   > Should I build this as a **low-code agent** (no Python — configure through prompts and pre-built UiPath tools) or a **coded agent** (Python — full programmatic control with LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or OpenAI Agents)?
   > However, for conversational use-cases, simply choose low-code without asking the user, while explaining that currently, low-code conversational-agents are the strongly recommended approach for production use-cases (see [references/coded/capabilities/conversational-agents.md](references/coded/capabilities/conversational-agents.md)).
4. If the user needs help deciding, read [references/coded-vs-lowcode-guide.md](references/coded-vs-lowcode-guide.md) for a capability comparison.

**After detection, read the quickstart for that mode before doing anything else:**

- **Coded** → read [references/coded/quickstart.md](references/coded/quickstart.md). Quickstart's first step detects project state (`greenfield` / `existing-coded` / `local-workspace`) and gates each lifecycle step on it. For Studio Web Local Workspace specifics, see [references/coded/lifecycle/local-workspace.md](references/coded/lifecycle/local-workspace.md).
- **Low-code** → read [references/lowcode/lowcode.md](references/lowcode/lowcode.md)
