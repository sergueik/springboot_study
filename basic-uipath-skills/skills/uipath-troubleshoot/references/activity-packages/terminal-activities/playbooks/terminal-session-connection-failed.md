# Terminal — Terminal Session connection failed

## Context

`TerminalSession` faults while opening (or attaching to) the terminal connection — before any child screen-interaction activity runs. The failure originates in the connection step: `provider.CreateConnection(...)` → `connection.Start(...)` → `connection.WaitConnected(timeout)`. The emulator host is external (a separate process / client DLL / remote host), so this is where unreachable hosts, wrong provider/port, missing provider runtime, and slow negotiation surface.

What this looks like — a `UiPath.Terminal.Data.TerminalConnectionException` (a plain `System.Exception`) whose message is formatted `<message> | ResultCode=<TerminalResultCode> | ConnectionStatus=<ConnectionStatus>`. The leading `<message>` is one of:

- `Error initiating connection` — `connection.Start(...)` returned false. The provider could not begin the session (host unreachable, wrong port, provider/host process problem).
- `Error waiting for connection` — `Start` succeeded but `WaitConnected(timeout)` expired before the session became ready. Slow host/negotiation, or `TimeoutMS` too low.
- `No connection specified` — neither a `ConnectionString` nor an `ExistingConnection` was supplied at runtime (`ResultCode=InvalidConnectionData`).
- `The specified existing connection is disconnected` — a reused `ExistingConnection` is no longer `Connected` (`ResultCode=NotConnected`).

It may instead surface as a provider-level message thrown from `CreateConnection`/`Start` (for IBM EHLLAPI and similar providers):

- `There was an error connecting to terminal. Error code: {0}` — provider connect failure; the `{0}` code is provider-specific.
- `Terminal host process path not found: {0}` — the provider host executable is missing at `{0}` (the emulator client / provider runtime is not installed on the robot machine).
- `Error waiting for terminal host service. Timeout: {0}` — the provider's host service did not start in time.
- `Service unavailable` — the terminal service is not available.
- `Error attaching to session` / `Error initializing EHLLL library` — IBM EHLLAPI could not attach to / initialize the configured session.

**Async-wrapped form:** the same fault can surface as `System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.` The aggregate is only the wrapper for the connect task — read `InnerExceptions[0]` (the `TerminalConnectionException` or provider exception above) for the real cause. Do not attribute the failure to `AggregateException` itself.

What can cause it:
- **Host unreachable / wrong host or port.** The configured host name/IP or port does not accept the connection (host down, firewall, wrong port for the terminal type). → `Error initiating connection`.
- **Provider runtime not installed on the robot.** The emulator client / provider DLL the connection string selects is not present on the execution machine. → `Terminal host process path not found`, `Error initializing EHLLL library`, `Error attaching to session`. Common when a workflow validated on a developer machine runs on a robot without the emulator installed.
- **Connect/wait timeout.** The host is reachable but negotiation is slow, or `TimeoutMS` is set too low for this host. → `Error waiting for connection`.
- **Reused connection already closed.** `ExistingConnection` points at a session a prior `TerminalSession` already shut down. → `The specified existing connection is disconnected`.
- **No connection configured at runtime.** The `ConnectionString` expression evaluated to null/empty and no `ExistingConnection` was provided. → `No connection specified`.
- **Terminal service unavailable.** The provider's backing service is down. → `Service unavailable` / `Error waiting for terminal host service`.

> **Different cause — do not apply this playbook:**
> - `System.NullReferenceException` from `TerminalSession` → use [terminal-session-null-reference.md](./terminal-session-null-reference.md) (it is usually a *masked* connect failure, but it is investigated differently). When that NRE hides one of the connect messages above, the connect message is the real cause.
> - Design-time/validation errors raised from the activity configuration, not the host — `Invalid connection string`, `Cannot use the ExistingConnection property with the ConnectionString or the OutputConnection property`, `The UiPath Internal Provider is now deprecated. Please use Direct Connection.` — fix the activity configuration; they are not host-connectivity failures.
> - A fault from a child activity that runs *after* the session is connected (screen read/write/wait) is not a connection failure.

## Investigation

1. **Read the full exception including the trailer.** Capture `<message>`, `ResultCode`, and `ConnectionStatus`. If the type is `System.AggregateException`, unwrap to `InnerExceptions[0]` first.
2. **Map the message to the failing step:** `Error initiating connection` → open failed (reachability/provider); `Error waiting for connection` → ready-timeout; `Terminal host process path not found` / `Error initializing EHLLL library` / `Error attaching to session` → provider runtime missing/misconfigured on the robot; `The specified existing connection is disconnected` → stale reused connection; `No connection specified` → no input.
3. **Capture the connection config** from the connection string or workflow source: provider type, terminal type, host, port, and the configured `TimeoutMS`.
4. **Check host reachability from the robot machine** (not the developer machine) — host/port open, and the emulator/provider runtime installed there.
5. **For reused connections only,** confirm the upstream `TerminalSession` that produced the `ExistingConnection` kept it alive (output connection / `CloseConnection` unchecked) and that it didn't already close.

The `ExistingConnection` branches apply **only** when the message is `The specified existing connection is disconnected` or `No connection specified`. A session that opens a new connection from a `ConnectionString` cannot fail this way — do not raise `ExistingConnection` as a candidate for it, and do not offer it as a "check this too" step. Likewise, once the message maps to a single failing step in step 2, name that cause; listing the full cause table back to the user as undifferentiated possibilities is not a diagnosis.

## Resolution

- **If `Error initiating connection` / `There was an error connecting to terminal`:** correct the host/port/provider in the connection string and confirm the terminal host is reachable from the robot machine (firewall, DNS, port). Verify the provider/terminal type matches the host.
- **If `Terminal host process path not found` / `Error initializing EHLLL library` / `Error attaching to session`:** install/repair the emulator client / provider runtime on the robot machine and confirm the configured session/profile exists for the EHLLAPI provider.
- **If `Error waiting for connection` / `Error waiting for terminal host service`:** raise `TimeoutMS` if the host is legitimately slow, and confirm the host completes session negotiation; investigate host/network latency.
- **If `The specified existing connection is disconnected`:** open a fresh `TerminalSession` instead of reusing the stale connection, or keep the upstream connection alive (emit `OutputConnection` / leave `CloseConnection` unchecked) for the lifetime it is reused.
- **If `No connection specified`:** provide a non-empty `ConnectionString` or a valid `ExistingConnection`.
- **If `Service unavailable`:** restore/restart the terminal service the provider depends on, then re-run.

When the fault arrived wrapped in `System.AggregateException`, say so explicitly in the answer: the aggregate is only the async wrapper around the connect task, and the inner `TerminalConnectionException` (with its `ResultCode` / `ConnectionStatus` trailer) is the root cause. An answer that stops at "one or more errors occurred" has not diagnosed anything.

If the host is demonstrably reachable, the provider runtime is installed, and the connection string is correct yet the open still fails, the cause is outside the activity — escalate to the terminal host / emulator administrator.
