# Word COM / Office Interop Failures & Word Process Crashes

## Context

This playbook covers **environmental / host-level** failures of the Word COM (Office Interop) layer that the `UiPath.Word.Activities` package depends on. It is **not specific to one activity** — any operation that drives a real `WINWORD.EXE` through Office Interop can surface these, including the `Use Word File` (`WordProcessScope`) / `Word Application Scope` container itself and the activities inside it (`Add Picture`, `Replace Text`, `Get Text`, `Set Bookmark Content`, `Export to PDF`, etc.). When the failure is genuinely activity-specific (a misplaced activity, a missing bookmark, a bad image path), use that activity's own playbook instead — this one is for the COM/host layer that is common to all of them.

What this looks like:
- `System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast COM object of type 'System.__ComObject' / 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationClass' to interface type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word._Application'` (or `_Document`), carrying an `(Exception from HRESULT: 0x…)`.
- `The application is busy` / a call-rejected or retry HRESULT.
- **Microsoft Word (`WINWORD.EXE`) itself faults and closes** mid-operation, and the activity then throws a COM cast / RPC error on its async-completion path (e.g. `UiPath.Word.Activities.WordInteropActivity.EndExecute`).
- The job runs fine in Studio on the developer's machine but faults only on a specific robot host — a strong tell of an **environmental** difference, not a source bug.

## Causes

Name the confirmed sub-cause exactly. Do NOT assert a cause unless the investigation decision tree arrived at it.

- **E1. COM type library / class not registered.** `0x8002801D` (`TYPE_E_LIBNOTREGISTERED`, "Library not registered") or the sibling `0x80040154` (`REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`, "Class not registered"). The cast to the Word `_Application` interface fails **during Word COM startup** (`WordApplicationScopeRuntime.EnsureWordApplication`), before any document work. Typically follows a partial or failed Office update/repair that left the interop type library unregistered.
- **E2. Bitness mismatch.** A 32-bit/64-bit mismatch between the Studio/Robot process and the installed Office. Produces the same class of COM startup cast/registration failure as E1.
- **E3. Word busy or blocked.** `0x8001010A` (`RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER`, "The application is busy"), `0x80010001` (`RPC_E_CALL_REJECTED`), or `0x80010100` (`RPC_E_SYS_CALL_FAILED`). An orphaned/hung `WINWORD.EXE` from a prior run holds the COM server, or Word is blocked on a modal dialog (Protected View / Mark-of-the-Web "file from the internet", activation, recover/repair prompt). Often intermittent.
- **E4. Word process crash mid-operation (COM error is a downstream symptom).** `WINWORD.EXE` faults and closes *during* an operation. The activity's async-completion path then runs `QueryInterface` against the COM server / apartment that the dying process already tore down, and surfaces `0x8001010E` (`RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD`, "interface marshalled for a different thread") and/or an `InvalidCastException` on the Word `_Document` interface. **The HRESULT is the aftermath, not the originating fault — diagnose the crash, not the marshalling error.** Triggers: a host Office instability (any of E1–E3), or an operation that pushes Word past a resource/render limit on this install. One known Add-Picture-specific trigger is **inserting a very large but otherwise valid image at full resolution** — `Add Picture` exposes no resize property, so a multi-megapixel image is handed to Word un-downscaled. *(The large-image trigger is a suspected/contributing pattern observed in the field, not a documented defect — confirm it with the faulting module per Investigation.)*

  **Do not infer that a background/unattended project setting caused E4.** `RuntimeType: Unattended`, `RequiresUserInteraction: false`, or `requiresUserInteraction: false` describes how the job was configured; by itself it does not explain why an already-running `WINWORD.EXE` opened the document and then crashed during one operation. When the log proves that sequence, keep the diagnosis at E4 and recover the crash evidence. Recommend changing the interaction setting only when there is direct evidence that the robot could not create an interactive Windows session or was blocked on UI—not merely because the metadata says background/unattended.

## Investigation

1. **Decode the HRESULT and locate the faulting frame** from the job error and stack.
2. **Decision tree** (stop at the first match):
   - Cast to the Word **`_Application`** interface failing in `EnsureWordApplication` / `WordApplicationScopeRuntime` during **startup**, with `0x8002801D` or `0x80040154` → **E1** (or **E2** if Studio/Robot and Office bitness differ — check both before concluding).
   - "Application is busy" / call-rejected / retry-later (`0x8001010A`, `0x80010001`, `0x80010100`) → **E3**. Check the robot host for an orphaned `WINWORD.EXE`, and for a modal/Protected-View state (especially if inputs came from `Downloads` / the internet — see Mark-of-the-Web).
   - Cast to the Word **`_Document`** interface with **`0x8001010E` (`RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD`)** on an async-completion frame (`WordInteropActivity.EndExecute`), **and/or the user reports that Word faulted and closed** → **E4**. The marshalling error is downstream of a process crash.
   - For E4, treat background/unattended metadata as context, not a confirmed trigger. If Word launched, opened the document, and crashed only after an activity began, do **not** replace the crash diagnosis with `Requires User Interaction = Yes`; identify the faulting module and test the host/image remediations below.
3. **For E4 — recover the crash forensics (decisive).** Pull the Windows **Application event log** record for the `WINWORD.EXE` crash — Event ID **1000** (`Application Error`), **1001** (Windows Error Reporting / APPCRASH bucket), or a `.NET Runtime` record — and read the **faulting module name + version** and **exception code** (e.g. `0xc0000005` access violation). The faulting module discriminates the trigger: a graphics / GDI+ / image-codec module points at an image-insert/render crash; an Office install / interop / loader module points at E1–E3; an RTF-import / document-conversion module points at a document-state interaction. If no crash record exists because the host's WER `ReportArchive` is saturated (e.g. another process is in a crash loop), restore WER retention or attach **ProcDump** to `WINWORD.EXE` (`procdump -e -ma WINWORD.EXE`) before reproducing. *(ProcDump and the WER archive are standard Microsoft/Sysinternals host tooling, not UiPath-documented steps.)*
4. **Capture the host Office state** for E1–E4: Office edition/channel and **bitness** (`File > Account > About Word`) versus the Studio/Robot process bitness; whether multiple Office installs coexist; and any orphaned `WINWORD.EXE` (Task Manager / `Get-Process WINWORD`).
5. **Confirm the workflow is not the cause.** If the activity is correctly scoped and its inputs are valid, and the same workflow succeeds in Studio on the developer's machine, the fault is environmental/host — do not edit the XAML.

## Resolution

Apply the fix for the identified sub-cause. The workflow itself usually needs no change.

- **E1 — type library / class not registered:** run an **online repair** of Microsoft Office on the robot host (`Settings > Apps > Microsoft Office > Modify > Online Repair`) to re-register the Office/Word COM type libraries. No workflow change required.
- **E2 — bitness mismatch:** reinstall Office at the same architecture as the Studio/Robot process (both 32-bit or both 64-bit).
- **E3 — busy / blocked:** kill any orphaned `WINWORD.EXE` (Task Manager / `Stop-Process -Name WINWORD -Force`) so the scope opens a clean instance, and ensure no `Try/Catch` swallows the scope's `Dispose`; dismiss/avoid modal and Protected-View states — if inputs are downloaded files, **unblock** them (`Right-click > Properties > Unblock` or `Unblock-File`) to clear the Mark-of-the-Web banner.
- **E4 — Word process crash:** this is a crash, not a marshalling bug.
  1. Apply the E1–E3 host remediation (repair Office, match bitness, clear orphaned `WINWORD.EXE`) — a destabilized Office install is the most common crash cause.
  2. If a specific operation reproducibly crashes Word with **valid** inputs, reduce what you hand Word. For `Add Picture` crashing on a large image, **pre-resize the image to a sane size before inserting it** (the activity has no resize property), use a smaller image, or insert via **`Paste Chart/Picture Into Document`** (clipboard) instead of the file-path insert.
  3. Capture the faulting module (Investigation step 3) to confirm the trigger before committing to a fix.
- **Fallback (any cause) — avoid Office Interop entirely:** migrate to the file-based `Word Document` activities (Studio panel under **System > File > Word Document**), which manipulate the `.docx` through the document object model without launching Word.

**Anti-pattern — interaction-setting guess:** Do not prescribe `Starts in Background = No` / `Requires User Interaction = Yes` as the primary fix for a confirmed mid-operation `WINWORD.EXE` crash without evidence that session creation or UI availability failed. That change can mask the actual Office/image instability and does not repair the crashed COM server.

**Prevention.** Treat a Word COM HRESULT (`0x8002801D` / `0x80040154` / `0x8001010A` / `0x8001010E`) — or a job that succeeds in Studio but faults only on a robot host — as an **environment problem on the host**, not a workflow defect. Investigate Office repair, bitness, orphaned processes, and (for crashes) the faulting module; do not edit the XAML.

If a COM failure persists after all environmental causes are ruled out, capture a `Verbose` robot log plus a Process Monitor trace and/or a **ProcDump** crash dump of `WINWORD.EXE` during the failure (and the offending input file, e.g. the image), and open a UiPath support case.
