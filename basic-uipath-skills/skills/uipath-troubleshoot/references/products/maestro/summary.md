> **API debuggability:** errors #1, #3, #5, #6, #8, #11, #13, #16, #19 are **Fully Troubleshootable** from PIMS API alone. Errors #2, #4, #10, #14, #17 are **Partially Troubleshootable** — incident gives a starting point but needs Orchestrator or BPMN inspection. Errors #7, #9, #12, #15, #18, #20 are **Not Troubleshootable** from API alone today; ask the user for additional artifacts (`.bpmn`, bindings, full stack trace).
>
> Error #9 (`NoOutgoingFlow`) becomes Fully Troubleshootable once the BPMN engine's gateway-debug-info incident enrichment lands and the `IncludeGatewayDebugInfoInIncidents` targeted feature flag is enabled.
