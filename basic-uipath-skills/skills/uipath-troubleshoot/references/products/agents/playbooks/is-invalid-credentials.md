# IS Invalid Credentials (401)

## Context

What this looks like:
- A deployed agent job or `uip agent debug` run faults during an IS tool call
- `uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json` contains a `toolCall` span whose `ATTRIBUTES.error` contains:
  ```
  {"details":"Invalid Organization or User secret, or invalid Element token provided.","message":"Failed to execute IS call to /curated_soqlQuery: HTTP Status: 401 - Unauthorized","status":400}
  ```
- The `message` field identifies the IS endpoint and connector type — the error is connector-agnostic (Salesforce, Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and others all produce the same 401 pattern)
- Failure is immediate (first IS call in the run); no successful IS calls precede it

What can cause it:
- IS connection is in the personal workspace or a folder different from where the agent executes — IS cannot resolve the connection at runtime (most common cause)
- OAuth client secret or API key stored in the IS connection was rotated or expired on the external system
- The user account whose delegated credentials are stored in the connection was deactivated or de-provisioned
- An Element token (connector-level auth) was manually revoked
- IS connection was created with sandbox credentials and deployed to production (or vice versa)

What to look for:
- Whether the connection is in the correct folder — `uip is connections list` and check the folder/scope
- Whether `details` says `Invalid Organization or User secret` (connection-level credentials) vs. `invalid Element token` (connector-level) — fix path differs
- Whether other IS connections to the same external system also return 401 (system-wide credential change vs. single-connection issue)

## Investigation

1. Get the spans for the failing run. If you already have a trace ID, use it directly. If you only have an Orchestrator job key, resolve it through traces:

   ```bash
   uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json

   # or
   uip traces spans get --job-key <job-key> --folder-path "<folder-path>" --output json
   ```

2. Pull the IS tool call span and extract the error:

   ```bash
   uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json \
     --output-filter "spans[?attributes.error != null].{name: name, spanType: spanType, error: attributes.error}"
   ```

3. Parse the error JSON to identify credential type:

   ```bash
   uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json \
     --output-filter "spans[?attributes.error != null].attributes.error" \
     | jq -r '.[] | fromjson | .details' 2>/dev/null \
     || grep -o '"details":"[^"]*"'
   ```

   - `Invalid Organization or User secret` → connection-level credentials invalid (OAuth client ID/secret or API key)
   - `invalid Element token` → connector-level Element token revoked

4. List IS connections and verify scope — the connection must be in the folder where the agent runs:

   ```bash
   uip is connections list --output json \
     --output-filter "connections[?name == '<connection-name>'].{id: id, name: name, connector: connector, folders: resource.folders}"
   ```

5. Ping to confirm authentication fails:

   ```bash
   uip is connections ping <connection-id> --force-refresh --output json
   ```

## Resolution

**If the connection is in the wrong folder or personal workspace:**

  Create a new connection scoped to the correct folder:

  ```bash
  uip is connections create <connector-key> --output json
  ```

  Note the new connection ID. Update `properties.connection.id`, `properties.connection.name`, and `solutionProperties.resourceKey` in `<agent-path>/resources/<ToolName>/resource.json` to the new connection ID — see [`uipath-agents`](/uipath:uipath-agents) IS tool reference for the full resource shape.

  Refresh and validate the agent:

  ```bash
  uip agent refresh "<AGENT_PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
  uip agent validate "<AGENT_PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
  ```

  After successful validation, report the result and ask whether the user wants to upload the corrected solution to Studio Web or publish/deploy it to Orchestrator. Do not perform any delivery action without explicit approval.

  > Use this same rebind, refresh, validate, and approval sequence for all resolution paths that create a new connection.

**If `Org/User secret` invalid — re-authenticate with updated credentials:**

  On the external system, regenerate the client secret. Then:

  ```bash
  uip is connections edit <connection-id>
  ```

  Complete OAuth flow with the new credentials.

**If `Element token` invalid — recreate the connection:**

  Element tokens cannot be refreshed in place. Delete the stale connection and create a new one:

  ```bash
  uip is connections delete <connection-id> --output json
  uip is connections create <connector-key> --output json
  ```

  Note the new connection ID. Then use the rebind sequence above.

**If the user account was deactivated or connection targets the wrong environment:**

  Delete the stale connection and create a new one in the correct context:

  ```bash
  uip is connections delete <connection-id> --output json
  uip is connections create <connector-key> --output json
  ```

  Note the new connection ID. Then use the rebind sequence above.
