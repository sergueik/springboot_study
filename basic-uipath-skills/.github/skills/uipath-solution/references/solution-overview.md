# Solutions (`uip solution`)

## What is a Solution?

A UiPath Solution is a container that groups multiple automation projects (processes, libraries, tests) into a single deployable unit. Solutions enable:

- **Bundled deployment** -- Deploy multiple projects together as one package
- **Version management** -- Track and version the entire solution as a single entity
- **Configuration management** -- Apply environment-specific configuration at deploy time
- **Multi-environment promotion** -- Move solutions through dev, staging, and production

### Platform availability

Solutions runs on Automation Cloud and — from **Automation Suite `2.2510.0`** onward — self-hosted Automation Suite. Not available on Standalone Orchestrator.

| Delivery option | Solutions |
|---|---|
| Automation Cloud / Automation Cloud Dedicated | ✅ |
| Automation Suite (self-hosted) | ✅ from `2.2510.0` (added to the AS product portfolio in that release) |
| Standalone | ❌ |

#### Available project types by Automation Suite version

This table is about the **Solutions feature** (`.uipx` bundling/deploy). Which project types a Solution can bundle/deploy on self-hosted Automation Suite depends on the AS version — the backing products land in different releases of the `2.2510` line.

| Automation Suite version | Project types deployable **as a Solution** (`.uipx`) |
|---|---|
| `< 2.2510.0` | None as a Solution — the Solutions feature is not on Automation Suite yet. **RPA still runs**: processes / libraries / tests deploy to Orchestrator directly (classic publish → deploy), as they have on Automation Suite since well before Solutions |
| `2.2510.0`+ | RPA workflow (cross-platform / Windows — **not** Windows-Legacy), App, API workflow, Agent, Agentic process |
| `2.2510.2`+ | adds Maestro (self-hosted): agentic-orchestration / BPMN-process runtime |

- Pre-`2.2510.0` is a gap in the **Solutions packaging path only** — Orchestrator (and RPA on it) is supported on every Automation Suite version, including Standalone.
- From `2.2510.0`+, same Solution project-type set as cloud, gated by AS version. The Solutions feature itself is unsupported on Standalone at any version.
- Agent / agentic-process / API-workflow runtimes ship across the `2.2510` patch line; confirm exact patch level against each product's Automation Suite release notes.

### Solution File Structure

```
MySolution/
├── MySolution.uipx                       <- Manifest. Source of truth: project list + IDs + StudioMinVersion.
├── <ProjectName>/
│   ├── project.uiproj OR project.json    <- Required for add/import. Type auto-detected.
│   ├── bindings.json                     <- Agent runtime bindings. NOT scanned by refresh.
│   ├── bindings_v2.json                  <- Solution refresh reads this (if it exists).
│   └── ...
├── <AnotherProjectName>/                 <- A solution can host many projects side-by-side.
│   ├── project.uiproj OR project.json
│   ├── bindings_v2.json
│   └── ...
├── <AppV2ProjectName>/                   <- AppV2 coded app (Coded or CodedAction).
│   ├── project.uiproj                    <- ProjectType: "AppV2".
│   ├── webAppManifest.json               <- Coded / CodedAction discriminator + bundlePath.
│   └── source/dist/                      <- Build output (bundlePath: "source/dist").
├── resources/                            <- Auto-generated on add/import. NEVER hand-edit.
│   └── solution_folder/
│       ├── package/<name>.json           <- Auto-created on add. NOT cleaned by `project remove`.
│       ├── process/{process,flow}/<name>.json   <- Auto-created on add. Auto-cleaned on remove.
│       └── app/{Coded,CodedAction}/<name>.json  <- AppV2 apps only. `kind: "app"`, `apiVersion: apps.uipath.com/v1`.
└── userProfile/<user-uuid>/              <- Appears after first `project remove`.
```

> `.uipx` and `resources/solution_folder/` must always agree on the set of projects. Diffing them is the fastest way to detect a corrupted state — see [develop-solution.md - Field-tested gotchas](develop-solution.md#field-tested-gotchas).
>
> The `.uipx` also carries a `StudioMinVersion` field (e.g. `2025.10.0`). If users hit a version-mismatch when opening the solution, that's the constraint to check.

> **AppV2 coded apps are first-class solution members when authored inside a `.uipx`.** They emit under `resources/solution_folder/app/{Coded,CodedAction}/`, pack / publish / deploy via `uip solution`, and are registered by `uip codedapp init` (run from inside the solution — auto-registers), `uip solution projects add`, or `uip solution projects import`. `uip codedapp init` is the solution-side entry point; standalone coded apps are scaffolded with `npx create-vite` instead and deploy through `uip codedapp pack` / `publish` / `deploy`. See [SKILL.md Rule 7](../SKILL.md#critical-rules) and [/uipath:uipath-coded-apps](/uipath:uipath-coded-apps).

> **`.uis` bundles and the `pack` `.zip` are plain zip archives — unzip to inspect bundled contents.**

## Solution Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[init] --> B[project add]
    B --> C[resources refresh]
    C --> D[pack]
    D --> E[publish]
    E --> F["deploy run<br/>(auto-activate by default)"]
    F -->|--skip-activate| G[activate]
    C --> H[upload]
```

Two distinct distribution paths from the same solution source:
- **`pack` → `publish` → `deploy run`** — promotes a versioned package to Orchestrator.
- **`upload`** — pushes the solution to Studio Web for browser-based debugging only. Does not produce a published package and cannot be deployed via `deploy run`.

Always run `resources refresh` before either path so the bundled artefact files and `userProfile/<userId>/debug_overwrites.json` reflect the current cloud state.
