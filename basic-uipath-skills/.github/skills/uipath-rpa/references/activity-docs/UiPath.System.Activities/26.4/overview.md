# UiPath System Activities

`UiPath.System.Activities`

Core general-purpose activities for every UiPath workflow. Covers file and folder operations, DataTable manipulation, text and date processing, collections, dialog boxes, credential management, environment interaction, workflow control, Orchestrator integration (queues, assets, jobs, storage), triggers, and scripting.

## Triggers in this package

This package ships three **integration triggers** ([`TimeTrigger`](activities/TimeTrigger.md), [`QueueTrigger`](activities/QueueTrigger.md), [`RuntimeContext`](activities/RuntimeContext.md) — Manual Trigger). All three return `isTrigger: true, triggerType: "integration"` from `uip rpa activities find`. The subscription is Orchestrator-native (scheduler, queue service, user-initiated start), so no `ConnectionId` is required. Place each as the first activity of the workflow's root `Sequence`; do **NOT** wrap in `ui:TriggerScope`. The handler is the rest of the `Sequence` that follows.

The package also ships **local triggers** (`RepeatTrigger`, `GlobalVariableChangedTrigger`, `FileChangeTriggerV3`) and the `TriggerScope` container. Local triggers have flexible placement — first activity of the root `Sequence`, or wrapped inside `<ui:TriggerScope.Triggers>`. See [trigger-pattern-guide.md](../../../trigger-pattern-guide.md) for the full pattern.
