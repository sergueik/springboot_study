## XAML Example

```xml
<ui:ReadStorageText
    xmlns:ui="clr-namespace:UiPath.Core.Activities.Storage;assembly=UiPath.System.Activities"
    DisplayName="Read Storage Text"
    Path="[&quot;data/output.txt&quot;]"
    Encoding="[&quot;utf-8&quot;]"
    Result="{x:Reference fileContent}" />
```

## Notes

- Requires an active Orchestrator connection with access to storage buckets.
- The storage bucket name and folder path are configured in the Orchestrator connection context (via `StorageBucketName` and `FolderPath` inherited from the base storage activity class).
- `Path` is the full file path within the bucket, including the file name and extension.
- `Encoding` can be configured as a project-level setting (section `ReadTextFile`, property `Encoding`) so it applies consistently across the project without setting it on each activity instance.
- If the file does not exist in the bucket, the activity throws a runtime error.
- To write text content to a storage file, use **Write Storage Text**.
