## Valid Configurations

- Either `Filter` (OData string expression) or `FilterBuilder` (visual widget) may be used to apply filter criteria. The designer provides a menu toggle to switch between the two modes.
- `FilterBuilder` supports the following criteria fields: **State**, **JobPriority**, **Key**, **ReleaseName**, **CreationTime**, **StartTime**, **EndTime**.
- `Skip` and `Top` provide pagination support for large result sets.

## XAML Example

    Top="[20]"
    Result="[jobs]"
    xmlns:ui="clr-namespace:UiPath.Core.Activities;assembly=UiPath.System.Activities" />
```

## Notes

- Requires an active Orchestrator connection. The robot must be connected to Orchestrator at runtime.
- `Result` is a collection of `OrchestratorJob` objects. Each object exposes properties such as `Id`, `Key`, `State`, `ReleaseName`, `StartTime`, `EndTime`, and `Info`.
- `FolderPath` is an advanced/hidden property that overrides the Orchestrator folder context for the query.
- Use `Top` to limit result size. Without it, the API may return a large number of records.
