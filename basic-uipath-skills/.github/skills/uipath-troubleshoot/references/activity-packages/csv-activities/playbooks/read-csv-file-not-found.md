# Read CSV — "Could not find file" / "Could not find a part of the path"

## Context

What this looks like:
- `Read CSV` faults with `Could not find file '<path>'` (`System.IO.FileNotFoundException`) or `Could not find a part of the path '<path>'` (`System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`).
- The path *looks* right, and the file may even exist when you check manually afterward.

What can cause it:
- **Asynchronous download timing.** A preceding step downloads / generates the CSV (HTTP download, an export, a cloud sync), and `Read CSV` runs before the file is fully written to disk — so at read time the file isn't there yet.
- **Path variable wrapped in quotes.** The `FilePath` expression quotes the variable *name* (e.g. `"MyPathVar"`) instead of using the variable, so the literal string `MyPathVar` is treated as the path — which doesn't exist. Or a hard-coded path has a typo / wrong folder.
- **Relative path / working-directory drift.** A relative path resolves against the robot's working directory, not where the file actually is, so a part of the path is missing.

What to look for:
- Whether a download/export/sync step runs immediately before `Read CSV` (timing/race).
- The `FilePath` expression in the `.xaml`: is the variable quoted as a literal string? Is the path relative? Does the folder portion exist?
- Whether the failure is intermittent (points at a timing race) or every run (points at a wrong/quoted path).

**Discriminator — the file's presence afterward decides the branch.** If the file is sitting at the
*exact path from the error message* when someone checks later, the path was correct all along: a
quoted-literal or drifted relative path resolves somewhere the file never appears, so it could not
produce the file at that path. That single observation **excludes** the quoted-path and
working-directory branches and confirms timing. Combined with an intermittent failure pattern (fails
most runs, occasionally works) it is conclusive — lead with the race, do not report a path problem as
the primary cause and the race as a secondary possibility.

The converse also holds: if the file is genuinely not at that path afterward, timing is excluded and
the cause is the path expression itself.

## Investigation

1. Read the error and the resolved path from job evidence; confirm it is `Could not find file` / `Could not find a part of the path` at `Read CSV`.
2. Read the `Read CSV` `FilePath` expression from the `.xaml`: is it a bare variable, a quoted literal, a relative path? Does the directory portion exist on the host?
3. Check what runs immediately before the read — a download/export/sync — and whether failures are intermittent (race) vs every run (bad path).
4. Establish whether the file is present at the error's exact path after the fault, and apply the discriminator above. Ask the user if it is not already in evidence — it is the cheapest decisive fact available, and it settles the branch on its own.

## Resolution

- **If the file is produced just before the read (race):** insert a wait before `Read CSV` — a `File Exists` retry loop (poll until the file is present, with a timeout), or a brief `Delay`. Prefer the retry loop over a fixed delay so it is robust to variable download times.
- **If the path variable is quoted as a literal:** pass the variable itself, not its name in quotes — use `MyPathVar`, not `"MyPathVar"`, in the `FilePath` expression.
- **If the path is wrong / relative:** use a correct absolute path (or build it explicitly, e.g. with `Path.Combine`) so the directory portion resolves on the robot host.
- **General:** guard the read with a `File Exists` check and fail with a clear message when the file is genuinely absent, so a timing race is distinguishable from a wrong path.
