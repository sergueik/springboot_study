# Invoke Workflow / Start Triggers Failed

## Context

`Invoke Workflow File` (or `Start Triggers`, which invokes a workflow) faulted **at run time**. The
failure can be in locating the workflow, in passing arguments, in the session/isolation configuration,
or inside the invoked child workflow itself.

For **design/build-time** Studio errors on `Invoke Workflow File` — an unknown-member /
package-version load failure, a project-cache "invoked workflows missing" fault, an invoked `.xaml`
excluded from the package, or a newly required argument left unmapped — use
[invoke-workflow-file-design-time-errors.md](./invoke-workflow-file-design-time-errors.md).

> For trigger **infrastructure** failures — a `Trigger Scope` / `Run Local Triggers` that fails to
> compile, register its triggers, or start/stop monitoring (missing/stale
> `.local\generated\Triggers.Generated.xaml`, duplicate `TriggerId` / mismatched Form field key, a
> `Trigger Scope` that blocks the flow, legacy `UiPath.Core.Activities` package conflict, hotkey won't
> bind) — see [trigger-scope-and-local-triggers-failed.md](./trigger-scope-and-local-triggers-failed.md).
> This playbook covers only `Start Triggers` acting as a **workflow invoker**.

What this looks like:
- The invoked workflow file cannot be found or loaded at run time
- An argument mismatch — the arguments passed do not match the invoked workflow's argument names,
  types, or directions
- A validation error about isolated / elevated / target-session settings (e.g. a non-current target
  session or elevated execution requires isolated execution)
- An error that persistence is not supported in the current runtime
- The child workflow ran and threw its own exception, which propagates up through the invoke

What can cause it:
- The workflow file path is wrong on the robot machine, or the `.xaml` was not published/included in
  the package
- Argument names/types/directions drifted between the caller and the invoked workflow (a renamed or
  retyped argument)
- Isolated/elevated/target-session options set in a combination the runtime does not allow (a
  non-`Current` `TargetSession` requires `UnSafe`/isolated = True)
- A `Start Triggers` placed somewhere other than directly inside a `Sequence` (its parent constraint)
- The invoked workflow contains a persistent activity (e.g. `RunJob` in Suspend mode, a
  `WaitFor…AndResume`), but the process has `runtimeOptions.supportsPersistence: false` (or the invoke
  is isolated, which cannot persist) — persistence is not supported in the current runtime
- The real error is inside the child workflow — the invoke is just the propagation point

What to look for:
- The invoked workflow path and whether it exists in the published package on the robot (also check
  `project.json` `designOptions.processOptions.ignoredFiles` — a listed `.xaml` is excluded from the
  package and will be missing at run time even though it exists in source)
- The argument list on the invoke vs the invoked workflow's declared arguments
- The isolated (`UnSafe`) / elevated / target-session settings on the invoke
- Whether the invoked workflow persists while `supportsPersistence` is false
- Whether the stack/inner exception points inside the child workflow rather than the invoke itself

## Investigation

1. Identify the invoke activity and the workflow file it targets; confirm that file is present in the
   running package on the robot.
2. Compare the arguments passed against the invoked workflow's declared arguments (name, type,
   direction).
3. Inspect the isolated (`UnSafe`) / elevated / target-session settings for an unsupported combination
   (non-`Current` `TargetSession` without `UnSafe=True`).
4. For `Start Triggers`, confirm it sits directly inside a `Sequence`.
5. If the error is that persistence is not supported: check whether the invoked workflow contains a
   persistent activity and whether `project.json` `runtimeOptions.supportsPersistence` is `false` (or
   the invoke runs isolated).
6. Read the inner/innermost exception — if it originates inside the child workflow, switch the
   investigation to that activity/playbook.

## Resolution

- **If the workflow file is missing:** correct the path, or ensure the `.xaml` is included in the
  published package — if it is listed in `project.json` `designOptions.processOptions.ignoredFiles`,
  remove it so it packs.
- **If arguments mismatch:** align the invoke's arguments with the invoked workflow's declared
  arguments (names, types, in/out directions).
- **If isolated/elevated/session settings are invalid:** set a supported combination (e.g. set
  `UnSafe`/isolated = True when the invoke uses a non-`Current` `TargetSession` or elevated execution).
- **If `Start Triggers` has the wrong parent:** place it directly inside a `Sequence`.
- **If persistence is not supported:** set `runtimeOptions.supportsPersistence: true` in `project.json`
  (and run on a persistence-capable runtime), or remove the persistent activity / do not invoke the
  persisting workflow isolated.
- **If the child workflow threw:** diagnose the failing activity inside the child workflow using its
  own signature/playbook; the invoke is only relaying the error.
