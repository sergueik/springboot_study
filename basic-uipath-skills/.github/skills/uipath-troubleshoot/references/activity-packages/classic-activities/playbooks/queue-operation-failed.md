# Queue Operation Failed (Add/Get Queue Item)

## Context

`Add Queue Item` failed while pushing an item into an Orchestrator queue, or `Get Queue Item`
(`GetQueueItem`) failed while reading from one. The shared branches cover `QueueName` resolution and
errors returned by Orchestrator. Item-information validation applies only to `Add Queue Item`.

What this looks like:
- "\"Queue name\" may not be null or empty." — the queue name input was not set
- `NoSuchQueue does not exist. Error code: 1002` (often inside an HTTP 404
  `OrchestratorHttpException`) — the resolved queue name was unavailable in the job folder
- For `Add Queue Item`, an error about invalid characters in an item-information key — keys may not
  contain certain characters (`.`, `#`, `@`, `:`)
- For `Add Queue Item`, "An item name from the '{0}' collection is the duplicate of another item name
  in the '{1}' collection" — the same key appears in both `ItemInformation` and
  `ItemInformationCollection`
- An Orchestrator error: queue does not exist, permission denied, HTTP error, or a timeout

What can cause it:
- The `QueueName` input is empty or resolved to null from an unset variable/argument
- A queue with that name does not exist in the folder where the job runs
- The robot account lacks the queue permission required by the operation in that folder
- For `Add Queue Item`, item-information keys contain reserved characters, or the same key is supplied
  twice across the two collections
- Network/connectivity or session issues between the robot and Orchestrator, causing an HTTP error or
  timeout

What to look for:
- The resolved `QueueName` and the folder the job runs in
- For `Add Queue Item`, the item-information keys being sent (reserved characters, duplicates)
- The HTTP status / error text returned by Orchestrator, if any
- Whether the queue exists in that folder and the robot account has rights to the required operation

## Investigation

1. Identify the failing `Add Queue Item` or `Get Queue Item` / `GetQueueItem` and the resolved
   `QueueName` from the correlated job record, logs, or traces.
2. Confirm the queue exists in the exact Orchestrator folder where the job runs. Try the documented
   exact-name lookup first and preserve its response:
   ```
   uip or queues list --folder-key <folder-key> --name "<queue-name>" --output json \
     | tee .local/investigations/raw/triage-queue-exact.json
   ```
   If that request returns `Result=Failure` / `HTTP 400: Invalid OData query options`, it is a failed
   query, not proof that the queue is absent. Preserve it, then retry once without the backend name
   filter and filter the small response client-side:
   ```
   uip or queues list --folder-key <folder-key> --output json \
     --output-filter "[?Name=='<queue-name>'].{Key:Key,Name:Name}" \
     | tee .local/investigations/raw/triage-queue-folder-fallback.json
   ```
   An empty successful fallback supports current absence only after the folder key is verified. For
   incidents older than 24 hours, current absence cannot distinguish never-created from deleted-since;
   the correlated runtime 404 establishes only that the name was unavailable then.
3. If a validation error fired, inspect the empty queue name and — for Add only — reserved characters
   or duplicate keys across `ItemInformation` and `ItemInformationCollection`.
4. If Orchestrator returned an error, read the HTTP status / message — distinguish permission denied,
   not found, and timeout.
5. Confirm the robot account is authenticated and has the queue permission required by that operation
   in the folder.
6. **Enumerate queues in the other folders the identity can see**, not just the job's folder. This is
   what closes the wrong-execution-folder branch: if the queue exists elsewhere, the process is running
   in the wrong folder and that is the fix; if no folder holds it, the branch is excluded and only
   wrong-name and missing-queue remain. Report the result either way — "the job's folder has no queues"
   leaves the branch open, "no visible folder holds this queue" closes it.
7. When runtime evidence proves the queue name was unavailable but does not explain why that name was
   used, check the working-directory source boundary from `SKILL.md` §5: inspect the named workflow and
   `project.json` if present. If source is unavailable, leave wrong name, deleted/missing queue, and
   wrong execution folder as explicit conditional branches; do not pick one from the activity display
   name or a suggestive suffix.

**State the evidence boundary as two separate claims.** Keep what the runtime response proves apart from
what it cannot: the correlated 404 / error 1002 establishes that the name was unavailable **at run
time** — that part is settled, not a hypothesis. Whether the name is wrong, the queue was deleted, or
the process ran in the wrong folder is what remains open, and only source or folder inventory closes it.
Blurring the two into one hedge understates a conclusion you have actually established.

## Resolution

- **If the queue name is empty:** set `QueueName` (ensure the upstream variable/argument that feeds it
  is populated).
- **If the queue name is wrong in source/configuration:** correct the activity's `QueueName` (or the
  upstream variable/config value feeding it), then republish through the normal project lifecycle.
- **If the intended queue is missing or was deleted:** create/recreate it in the job folder with the
  intended schema and settings.
- **If the intended queue exists in another folder:** run/deploy the process in that folder, or define
  the intended queue in the current job folder.
- **If evidence cannot choose among the wrong-name, missing/deleted, and wrong-folder branches:** lead
  with the source/configuration check that discriminates them, then present each as a labelled
  conditional fix — **either** create/recreate the queue under the exact name the activity references,
  **or** correct the activity's `QueueName` to an existing queue and republish, **or** run the process
  in the folder that holds the intended queue. Naming only one of them is an incomplete answer: without
  the project source you cannot tell whether the name is wrong or the queue is gone, so the user needs
  every branch that the evidence still allows. Do not create a queue merely because a not-found response
  occurred.
- **If keys contain reserved characters:** rename the Add item's information keys to remove `.`, `#`,
  `@`, `:`.
- **If a key is duplicated across the two collections:** remove the duplicate so each Add item key
  appears once.
- **If permission is denied:** grant the robot account the least queue permission required by the
  failing Add/Get operation in that folder.
- **If it's a network/HTTP/timeout error:** address robot↔Orchestrator connectivity and retry.
