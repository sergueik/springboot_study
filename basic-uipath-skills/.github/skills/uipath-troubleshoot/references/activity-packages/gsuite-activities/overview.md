# Google Workspace Activities

Activities from the `UiPath.GSuite.Activities` package for automating Google Workspace services: Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Tasks, Google Forms, and Apps Script. Modern activities call Google REST APIs through OAuth-authenticated connections managed by Integration Service; legacy XAML activities use a `GSuiteApplicationScope` container (Windows only).

## How Connections Work

Modern activities are suffixed `*Connections` (e.g., `GetNewestEmailConnections`). When the activity executes, it:

1. Resolves the configured Integration Service connection to obtain an OAuth access token
2. Issues a Google REST API request (Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Calendar, Docs, Tasks, Forms, or Apps Script)
3. Maps the Google API response back into the activity output, or throws on error

Failures can originate at any of those layers — connection resolution (Integration Service), token validation (Google OAuth), the API call itself (Google service), or post-processing inside the activity. Knowing which layer produced the error narrows the investigation.

## Key Activity Types

### Gmail

- **Get Newest Email** (`GetNewestEmailConnections`) — retrieves the single most recent message matching a configured filter.
- **Send / Reply / Forward Email** (`SendEmailConnections`, `ReplyToEmailConnections`, `ForwardEmailConnections`, plus legacy `SendEmail`) — send, reply, or forward a Gmail message. Uploads attachments via Gmail multipart upload, so they share Drive-class quota failures. Legacy `SendEmail` validates each attachment path locally first (`File does not exist: <path>`) and requires at least one of `To`/`Cc`/`Bcc` unless `IsDraft`.

### Drive

- **Item write operations** (`CreateFolderConnections`, `CopyFileConnections`, `MoveFileConnections`, `RenameFileFolderConnections`, `UploadFilesConnections`, `CreateSpreadsheetConnections`, `CreateDocumentConnections`) — create, copy, move, rename, or upload Drive items; behavior on duplicate name in the destination is governed by the `ConflictResolution` enum (`Replace`, `Fail`, `Rename`, `AddSeparate`, `UseExisting`).
- **Item resolution by ID, URL, or path** (most Drive activities, e.g., `GetFileFolderConnections`, `GetFileFolderInfoConnections`, legacy `GetFileInfo`, `DownloadFileConnections`, `DeleteFileOrFolderConnections`, `ShareFileFolderConnections`, plus the write operations above) — resolve a target file or folder against the Drive API; fails with HTTP 404 when the identifier no longer resolves, or with `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (`Could not extract an object Id from the Url ...`) before the call when a passed URL has no extractable ID.
- **Upload Files** (`UploadFilesConnections`, legacy `UploadFile`) — upload local files into Drive via multipart upload; subject to user storage quota and shared-drive file-count limit.

### Sheets

- **Add Sheet** (`AddSheetConnections`) — add a new sheet (tab) to an existing spreadsheet; behavior on duplicate sheet name is governed by `ConflictResolution` (`Fail`, `Replace`, `Rename`).
- **Cell-writing / grid-expanding activities** (`WriteRangeConnections`, `WriteCellConnections`, `WriteRowConnections`, `WriteColumnConnections`, `AutoFillRangeConnections`, `CopyPasteRangeConnections`, `AddSheetConnections`, plus legacy `WriteCell`, `WriteRange`, `AppendRow`, `AddNewSheet`, `AddDeleteColumns`, `AddDeleteRows`, `AutoFillRange`, `CopyPasteRange`, `CopySheet`, `BatchUpdateValuesScope`) — write cells or expand the bounded grid; auto-expansion makes them subject to the spreadsheet-wide 10,000,000-cell cap. `CopySheet` is legacy-only and the most aggressive trigger.
- **Range-addressed activities** (`ReadCellConnections`, `ReadRangeConnections`, `ReadRowConnections`, `ReadColumnConnections`, `WriteCellConnections`, `WriteRangeConnections`, `WriteRowConnections`, `WriteColumnConnections`, `AutoFillRangeConnections`, `CopyPasteRangeConnections`, `DeleteRangeConnections`, `ForEachRowConnections`, `SetRangeColorConnections`, `GetCellColorConnections`, plus legacy `ReadCell`, `ReadRange`, `ReadRow`, `ReadColumn`, `WriteCell`, `WriteRange`, `AutoFillRange`, `CopyPasteRange`, `ClearRange`, `DeleteRange`, `ForEachSheetRow`, `GetCellColor`) — accept a range or cell address in A1 notation; the supplied range is forwarded to the Google Sheets API and validated server-side.

## Common Failure Patterns

### Gmail

- **Filter returns no matching email** — Gmail mailbox contains zero messages matching the configured filter at the moment the activity runs. `Get Newest Email` throws `GmailException: No email matching the search criteria has been found` synchronously, with no retry or wait. The `NewEmailReceived` / `EmailSent` triggers, run in debug/test mode, throw the related `No email matching the filter criteria, received/sent in the last 1 hour has been found...`.

### Drive

- **Item name conflict** — Drive write activity throws `GSuiteException: Multiple items with the name <name> found in the specified folder.` when the target folder already contains an item with that name and `ConflictResolution` cannot resolve the duplicate. Affects Create Folder, Copy File, Move File, Rename, Upload, Create Spreadsheet, and Create Document.
- **404 — resource not found / item does not resolve** — An activity fails to resolve its configured target (Drive file/folder/spreadsheet/document by ID/URL/path, a Gmail message by ID, or a browser-selected item) because the resource was deleted, trashed, or is not accessible to the connection. Surfaces as one of: `File not found: <id>. [404]` (raw `Google.GoogleApiException`), `The service <svc> has thrown an exception. HttpStatusCode is NotFound. ...` (wrapped form), `The resource was not found.` (translated form), or ``Cannot find item configured with connection `<id>` [at path `<path>`].`` (browser-selected item).
- **Upload storage quota or shared drive file limit exceeded** — Drive or Gmail attachment upload throws `GSuiteException: Upload failed after <N> bytes. ...` carrying a Google 403. Two underlying conditions: `storageQuotaExceeded` (user's Drive storage full) or `The file limit for this shared drive has been exceeded.` (shared drive at the 500K item cap). Affects `UploadFilesConnections`, legacy `UploadFile`, and Gmail send/reply/forward when the message has attachments.

### Sheets

- **Sheet name conflict** — `Add Sheet` throws `GSuiteException: A sheet with the same name already exists.` when the spreadsheet already contains a sheet with the configured `SheetName` (case-insensitive) and `ConflictResolution = Fail`. Restricted to `AddSheetConnections`.
- **10,000,000-cell limit exceeded** — Sheets write or grid-expand activity throws `GSuiteException` carrying a Google 400 BadRequest: `This action would increase the number of cells in the workbook above the limit of 10000000 cells.` The cap is the sum of the bounded grid (rows × columns) across every sheet in the spreadsheet, including empty cells. Hard Google quota; cannot be raised. Affects all cell-writing / grid-expanding Sheets activities.
- **Invalid range — unable to parse** — Range-addressed Sheets activity throws `GSuiteException` carrying a Google 400 BadRequest: `Invalid data[0]: Unable to parse range: <SheetName>!<CellRef>`. Common causes: 1-indexing mistake (`A0`), empty/null range variable, sheet name with spaces or special characters not single-quoted in A1 notation, stale sheet reference after a rename, or off-by-one in a dynamically-built address. Affects all range-addressed Sheets activities.

### Cross-cutting (any service)

These families are not specific to one Google service — any activity can hit them, and the failing layer (not the activity) determines the fix.

- **Connection / authentication / permission** — failure in the identity layers rather than the resource: an auth-phase `TimeoutException` (`Authentication attempt took longer than <N> seconds to complete, and was cancelled.`), an expired/invalid token (`Invalid authentication credentials.` / `Authentication error: the access token is expired or invalid.`), authorization denied (`Permission to the resource was denied.` / `The user does not have sufficient permissions for the file.` / domain policy), or a raw `ConnectionHttpException` when the Integration Service connection itself is unreachable/deleted (design-time browse failures carry `CNS1044`/`CNS1045`).
- **Invalid or null input (client-side)** — the activity throws *before* any Google API call because an input is null, empty, out of range, or an invalid combination: `Value cannot be null. (Parameter '<x>')`, `The object used in the activity does not exist.` (mapped `NullReferenceException`), `Column not found: <name>`, `RelativeRowIndex/RelativeColumnIndex <i> outside the range: 0 to <n>.`, `Named ranges with cell value are invalid. Named ranges require no cell input.`, `<property> must be a positive number`, `You do not have the following labels`. The fix is in the workflow inputs, not the connection or resource.
- **Transient / rate-limit / per-request timeout** — environmental and often temporary: Google 5xx (`Internal server error occurred. Please try again later.` / `The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.`), rate/quota limits at 429 (`The daily limit was exceeded.` / `The user rate limit was exceeded.` / `The rate limit was exceeded.`), network faults (`HttpRequestException`), a per-request `RequestTimeout` overrun (`A task was canceled.` — a `TaskCanceledException`, **not** a `TimeoutException`), or the generic fallback `An error occurred in the activity.` when the underlying status matched no known mapping. Triggers auto-retry socket errors and 5xx with backoff before surfacing.
