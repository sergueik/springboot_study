# UI Automation

Activities for interacting with desktop and web application UIs. Robots use selectors (XML descriptors of UI elements) to find and interact with buttons, text fields, tables, and other controls.

## How Selectors Work

A selector is an XML string that describes the path from the application window to the target UI element:

```xml
<html app='chrome.exe' title='Invoice Portal' />
<webctrl tag='BUTTON' aaname='Submit Invoice' />
```

When a robot executes a UI activity (Click, Type Into, Get Text, etc.), it uses the selector to locate the element in the live UI tree. If the element can't be found — because the UI changed, the element was renamed, or the layout shifted — the activity throws a `SelectorNotFoundException`.

## Key Activity Types

- **Click / NClick** — click a UI element
- **Type Into / NTypeInto** — type text into an input field
- **Get Text / NGetText** — extract text from a UI element
- **Set Text** — set the value of an input field
- **Check App State** — wait for a UI element to appear or disappear
- **Element Exists** — check if a UI element exists without interacting
- **Take Screenshot** — capture a screenshot of the application

## Exception Types

- **SelectorNotFoundException** — the selector didn't match any element in the UI tree. Most common failure.
- **UiElementNotFoundException** — UI element lookup failed (similar to selector not found, different internal path)
- **ElementNotInteractableException** — element was found but can't be clicked/typed into (hidden, disabled, covered by overlay)
- **UiNodeDisabledElementException** — element was found but is disabled and the activity's `AlterIfDisabled` property is not `True`. Driver HRESULT `E_UINODE_CANNOT_ALTER_DISABLED_ELEM` (0x8004027D). Raised by interaction activities `NClick`, `NTypeInto`, `NSetText`, `NCheck`, `NSelectItem`, `NSAPClickPictureOnScreen`.
- **VerifyActivityExecutionException** — activity's primary action succeeded but its `VerifyOptions` post-condition assertion did not hold within the verify retry window. Thrown by `VerifyExecutionService`, not COM-friendlied. Raised by `NClick`, `NHover`, `NKeyboardShortcuts`, `NTypeInto`. Multiple friendly messages route to distinct cause branches (`ExceptionCheckActivity`, `ExceptionVerificationTargetNotFoundOrInvalid`, `ExceptionVerificationTextNotSupported`, `ExceptionVerificationImageCouldNotBeRetrieved`, `ExceptionRecoveredButValidationFailed`, plus NTypeInto-specific text-match keys).
- **NodeNotFoundException** — DOM or UI tree node missing
- **NodeAmbiguousException** — selector matched more than one element. Distinct from `NodeNotFoundException` (zero matches): ambiguous = multiple matches.
- **TimeoutException** — activity exceeded its wait time (ambiguous — could be UI or non-UI)
- **ImageOperationException** — image-based UI automation failure
- **ScreenScrapingException** — screen scraping activity failure
- **ApplicationNotFoundException** — scope-level failure from `NApplicationCard` (Use Application / Use Browser) when the target application can't be located **and** the scope's `OpenMode=Never`. Distinct from `ApplicationOpenException` (which fires when `OpenMode != Never` and launch failed) and `WrongTargetApplicationException` (selector matched the wrong process).
- **UiAutomationException — "Cannot send input to UI element because it is outside of screen bounds."** — input activity (`NClick`, `NTypeInto`, ...) located the element but the destination coordinate is outside the runtime host's virtual screen. Wraps `COMException 0x800402bd` at `UiPath.UiNodeClass.Click`. Distinct from the selector-failure family — element was resolved, coordinate was rejected. See [click-coordinate-off-screen.md](./playbooks/click-coordinate-off-screen.md).

UIAutomationNext (`N*`) activities also raise these more specific exceptions:

- **RuntimeTimeoutException** — modern activity timeout ("Activity execution exceeded the set timeout."). A UI timeout can also surface as **NodeNotFoundException** when the element never appeared within the timeout window.
- **ApplicationOpenException** — a `Use Application/Browser` scope with `Open` ≠ `Never` tried to launch the app and the launch failed ("Could not open target application.")
- **WrongTargetApplicationException** — the identified element belongs to a different application/browser than the scope's target
- **BrowserFailedToNavigateToUrlException** / **BrowserInvalidURLException** — `Go To URL` could not navigate (failed navigation, invalid/empty URL, or a local `file://` blocked on Chromium)
- **InvalidNodeException** / **UiNodeUninitializedElementException** — the element went invalid/stale between being found and acted on
- **TargetFoundButNotVisibleException** — element found but its visibility did not match what the target expected
- **TargetNotFoundBrowserBlockedException** — element could not be reached because a dialog is blocking the browser
- **UiNodeHasNoItemsException** — Select Item's target container had no items
- **Browser communication failure — "Cannot communicate with the browser." / "Cannot access the indicated browser window."** — a `Use Browser` (`NApplicationCard`) scope or inner browser activity reached a running browser but the automation channel is broken: UiPath extension disabled/not-in-incognito, native-messaging host blocked by antivirus/policy, or browser↔package major-version skew. Distinct from launch failure (`ApplicationOpenException`) and not-found (`ApplicationNotFoundException`). See [browser-communication-failed.md](./playbooks/browser-communication-failed.md).
- **Design-time view failure — "Could not generate view for NApplicationCard" / "Object reference not set to an instance of an object"** — NOT a runtime exception. Studio cannot render the `Use Application/Browser` card on the design surface (Studio↔activity-package version skew or corrupted `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UiPath\.cache` / stale project cache). No job, log, or trace. See [napplicationcard-view-generation-failed.md](./playbooks/napplicationcard-view-generation-failed.md).
- **UiAutomationException (activity configuration)** — an activity rejected an invalid property value (e.g. Mouse Scroll `Movement units` < 1, Keyboard Shortcuts empty/invalid sequence, Take Screenshot missing `File name`/`Saved image`, Go To URL / Inject Js Script missing required input)
- **`Method not found: 'Void UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities...'`** — not an exception in the UI tree but a binding failure: the `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` package version restored where the project runs differs from the version it was built against (assembly version skew). Surfaces at Studio validation, build, or the first `NTypeInto`/`N*` activity on a robot after a dependency change or environment move. See [type-into-input-failed.md](./playbooks/type-into-input-failed.md) § (B).
- **Type Into text corruption (no exception)** — `NTypeInto` reports `Successful` but the value captured by the field is wrong (missing / scrambled / duplicated / out-of-order characters), usually from `HardwareEvents` outrunning a laggy target (`DelayBetweenKeys` too low), lost focus, an unsupported input method for Java/SAP, or an uncleared field. No-signature; route via the domain table. See [type-into-input-failed.md](./playbooks/type-into-input-failed.md) § (A).

Assembly load/bind failures (the activity's type fails to resolve **before** any selector is evaluated) surface as:

- **MissingMethodException — "Method not found: 'Void UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities…'"** — the `UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities` assembly loaded but a member the caller was compiled against is absent. A **version mismatch inside the project's dependency set** (`project.json`): a UI Automation package bumped out of step with `UiPath.System.Activities` or a sibling/library built against a different UIAutomationNext version. Fix is version alignment in Manage Packages. See [dependency-version-conflict.md](./playbooks/dependency-version-conflict.md).
- **FileNotFoundException / FileLoadException — "Could not load file or assembly 'UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities' … Version=…"** — the exact pinned version could not be loaded at all. Classic tell: **works in Studio, fails in Assistant / on the robot** — the robot's local NuGet cache (`%userprofile%\.nuget\packages`) or the Orchestrator feed cannot supply the version. Fix is cache clean + feed check + republish (Lowest Applicable / Strict). See [dependency-version-conflict.md](./playbooks/dependency-version-conflict.md).
