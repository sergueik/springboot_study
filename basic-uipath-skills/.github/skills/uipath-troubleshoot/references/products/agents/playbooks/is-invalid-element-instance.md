# IS Invalid Element Instance (404)

## Context

What this looks like:
- A deployed agent job or `uip agent debug` run faults during an IS tool call
- `uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json` contains a `toolCall` span whose `ATTRIBUTES.error` contains:
  ```
  {"detail":"Invalid Element Instance Id provided.","message":"Failed to execute IS call to /search: HTTP Status: 404 - Not Found","status":400}
  ```
- The IS endpoint in `message` varies (`/search`, `/records`, `/curated_contact`, etc.) but `detail` is always `Invalid Element Instance Id provided`
- Unlike 401/403 errors, this can fire mid-run — earlier IS calls in the same run may have succeeded

What can cause it:
- The IS connection referenced by the agent tool was deleted after the agent was published
- Agent deployed to a different environment (staging → production) where the source environment's IS connection does not exist — IS does not auto-create connections
- The connection ID in the agent's tool configuration was manually edited to a non-existent value
- A backend platform issue invalidated element instance IDs — `uip is connections list` shows the connection as healthy but the underlying instance is no longer valid; requires a support ticket

What to look for:
- Whether the agent was recently deployed to a new folder or environment
- Whether an IS administrator deleted the connection for this connector recently
- Whether user action (deletion, redeployment) explains the missing connection — if not, escalation is needed
- The tool name in the faulting span — identifies which IS connection the agent is trying to use

## Investigation

1. Get the spans for the failing run. If you already have a trace ID, use it directly. If you only have an Orchestrator job key, resolve it through traces:

   ```bash
   uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json

   # or
   uip traces spans get --job-key <job-key> --folder-path "<folder-path>" --output json
   ```

2. Pull the faulting `toolCall` span and note the span name:

   ```bash
   uip traces spans get <trace-id> --output json \
     --output-filter "spans[?attributes.error != null].{name: name, spanType: spanType, error: attributes.error}"
   ```

   The span `name` identifies which tool (and IS connection type) caused the 404.

3. List current IS connections and locate the connection the agent should be using:

   ```bash
   uip is connections list --output json \
     --output-filter "connections[*].{id: id, name: name, connector: connector}"
   ```

   - If no connection matches the connector type → the connection was deleted or never existed in this environment; proceed to Resolution.
   - If a matching connection exists and shows as healthy → suspect backend migration; capture the trace ID and escalate to the Integration Service team.

4. Ping the candidate connection to confirm it is active:

   ```bash
   uip is connections ping <connection-id> --force-refresh --output json
   ```

## Resolution

**If the connection was deleted — recreate it and rebind the agent:**

  Create a new IS connection:

  ```bash
  uip is connections create <connector-key> --output json
  ```

  Note the new connection ID from the output. The span name from step 2 identifies `<ToolName>`. Update `properties.connection.id`, `properties.connection.name`, and `solutionProperties.resourceKey` in `<agent-path>/resources/<ToolName>/resource.json` to the new connection ID — see [`uipath-agents`](/uipath:uipath-agents) IS tool reference for the full resource shape.

  Refresh and validate the agent:

  ```bash
  uip agent refresh "<AGENT_PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
  uip agent validate "<AGENT_PROJECT_DIR>" --output json
  ```

  After successful validation, report the result and ask whether the user wants to upload the corrected solution to Studio Web or publish/deploy it to Orchestrator. Do not perform any delivery action without explicit approval.

**If the connection doesn't exist in the target environment — create it first:**

  IS does not auto-create connections during agent deployment. Create the connection in the target environment:

  ```bash
  uip is connections create <connector-key> --output json
  ```

  Then update the `resource.json`, refresh, and validate using the same sequence above. After validation, ask whether the user wants to upload or publish/deploy the corrected solution.

**If the connection appears healthy but the 404 persists — escalate to Integration Service team:**

  Not user-fixable. Open a support ticket with UiPath and provide the trace ID and the connection ID from `uip is connections list`.
