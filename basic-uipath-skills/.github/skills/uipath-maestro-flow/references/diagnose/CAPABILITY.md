# Diagnose — Investigate failed or misbehaving flow runs

Capability index for postmortem on a failed `flow debug` or deployed process run. Diagnose owns the diagnostic priority ladder (incidents → runtime variables → flow correlation → traces) and the catalog of known recurring failure modes (MST-9107, MST-9061, HITL-stuck, reused reference IDs, single-nested layout). Requires `uip login`.

> **Where you came from / where to go next.** Diagnose is downstream of Operate (run faulted → diagnose) and points back to Author for the underlying fix (diagnose → re-author → re-ship). Re-running and lifecycle live in [operate/CAPABILITY.md](../operate/CAPABILITY.md); building/editing the `.flow` file lives in [author/CAPABILITY.md](../author/CAPABILITY.md).
>
> **Inherits universal rules from [SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md)** — `--output json` + prefer `--output-filter` for extraction, no `flow debug` without consent, never invoke other skills automatically, dropdown question pattern, **plain-English narration + granular progress list (opt-in — silent by default; engage when the user asks for verbosity)**. The rules below are diagnose-scoped and apply on top.

## When to use this capability

- Triage a failed `flow debug` or deployed process run
- Read incidents to identify the error category, message, and faulting element
- Inspect runtime variable state at the time of failure
- Map a faulting element ID back to a node in the `.flow` file
- Stream verbose traces for execution timeline
- Recognize known failure modes (MST-9107 missing `=js:`, MST-9061 format skipped, etc.)

## Critical rules

1. **Investigate in priority order — incidents → variables → flow correlation → traces.** Each step adds context; stop when you have enough to identify the root cause. Skipping ahead to traces is the most common mistake — they are verbose and last-resort. See [troubleshooting-guide.md](references/troubleshooting-guide.md).
2. **Always include `--folder-key <FOLDER_KEY>` (`-f` shorthand) on `instance` and `incident get` commands.** Without it the command rejects the request before reaching the API. Get the folder key from `uip or folders list --output json` or from the job/process context. See [shared/cli-conventions.md](../shared/cli-conventions.md#6---folder-key-requirement).
3. **Never call the underlying APIs directly — always use `uip` CLI commands.** The `instance` and `incident` subcommands are the supported diagnostic surface; direct API calls are not.
4. **When the local `.flow` may differ from the deployed BPMN, fetch the deployed asset.** Use `uip maestro flow instance asset <INSTANCE_ID> --folder-key <FOLDER_KEY> --output json` to see what actually ran. Do not assume your local file matches.

## Anti-patterns

- **Never start with traces.** They are verbose and contain the full execution timeline — useful only when incidents and variables are insufficient. Start with incidents (Step 2 of the priority ladder).
- **Never call the underlying APIs directly.** Always use `uip maestro flow instance` / `incident` / `job` subcommands. Direct API calls bypass the supported diagnostic surface.
- **Never assume the local `.flow` matches the deployed BPMN.** If there's any chance the deployed flow differs (a republish since the local edit, a different branch, a different solution version), fetch `instance asset` to see what actually ran. Otherwise your correlation between faulting element and `.flow` node will mislead you.
- **Never skip the `--folder-key` flag** on `instance` or `incident get` commands. The command rejects the request before reaching the API; the failure looks like a CLI error but is really a missing argument.
