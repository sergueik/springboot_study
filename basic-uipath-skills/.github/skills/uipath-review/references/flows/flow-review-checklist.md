# Flow Review Checklist

Comprehensive quality checklist for UiPath Flow projects (`.flow` files) — orchestration of RPA processes, agents, apps, and human tasks.

> **Unit of Work:** Before running the technical checks below, complete Step 3a (Unit of Work Discovery) from SKILL.md. For flows, the declared unit is in the `.flow` file under `variables.globals` with `direction: "in"` or `"inout"`. The actual unit is what the flow body produces — count downstream resource-node invocations and side effects per flow execution. If one flow invocation fans out to N downstream calls over a sub-collection of the input, the shape is one-to-many — assess per Step 3a (see [rpa-common-issues.md](../rpa/rpa-common-issues.md)).

## 1. Structural Validation

### File Presence

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|

uip maestro flow validate "<PROJECT_NAME>.flow" --output json
```

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|

| Decision node edges use correct port names (`true`/`false`) | Critical | Check decision node edges |
| Switch node edges use correct case port names | Warning | Check switch node edges |
| No duplicate edges between the same node pair on the same ports | Warning | Check for duplicate edges |

## 3. Node-Specific Quality

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Both `true` and `false` branches defined | Warning | Check outgoing edges |
| Default branch defined (to avoid runtime faults) | Warning | Check for default path |
| Condition expression is valid and testable | Warning | Read condition |

| Resource input schemas match flow variable types | Warning | Compare schemas |
| Resource output mapped to flow variables correctly | Warning | Check output mappings |

### Resource Type Appropriateness

| Resource Type | Correct Usage | Flag If |
|---|---|---|
| `uipath.core.rpa-workflow.*` | Invoking published RPA processes | Used for agent-type tasks |
| `uipath.core.agent.*` | Invoking published AI agents | Used for deterministic rule-based tasks |

| `uipath.agent.autonomous` | Classification, triage, reasoning | Used for simple data transformation |
| `core.action.script` | Deterministic data transformation | Used for LLM reasoning tasks |

### Agent Node vs Script Node Decision

| Use Script When | Use Agent When |
|---|---|
| Logic is deterministic and rule-based | Input is ambiguous, requires reasoning |
| Rules are known and enumerable | Natural language generation needed |
| Data transformation, filtering, mapping | Classification, triage, or summarization |
| Calculations, lookups, formatting | Understanding unstructured content |

**Flag:** Agent nodes used for deterministic tasks as **Info** (unnecessary cost). Script nodes used for tasks requiring reasoning as **Warning** (insufficient capability).

## 5. Orchestration Patterns

| No orphan definitions (types not used by any node) | Info | Cross-reference definitions and nodes |
| Definition versions match node `typeVersion` | Warning | Compare versions |

## 8. Maestro BPMN Projects

Maestro BPMN (`.bpmn` + `project.uiproj` with `"ProjectType": "ProcessOrchestration"`) is a separate project type — review it with [bpmn-review-checklist.md](../bpmn/bpmn-review-checklist.md), not this checklist.

### Flow vs Maestro BPMN Fitness

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Flow complexity appropriate (simple flows don't need Maestro BPMN) | Info | Assess process complexity |
| Long-running, multi-actor processes use Maestro BPMN (not simple flows) | Warning | Check process duration and actor mix |
| Human-in-the-loop steps needing case tracking/SLA use Maestro User Tasks | Warning | Check for HITL requirements |
| Process mining integration needed → Maestro BPMN (auto-creates Process Optimization apps) | Info | Check monitoring needs |

## 9. Performance and Optimization

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Decision nodes placed early (fail-fast patterns) | Info | Review decision placement |
| Large payloads not carried through unnecessary nodes | Info | Check variable lifecycle |
| Subflows used for repeated logic (DRY principle) | Info | Identify duplicated patterns |
| Parallel execution used where items are independent | Info | Check for sequential processing of independent items |
| Script nodes don't perform work that should be in RPA/agent resources | Warning | Review script complexity |

## 10. Deployment Readiness

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Flow validates without errors | Critical | `uip maestro flow validate` |
| All resource bindings resolved | Critical | Check bindings_v2.json |
| No mock placeholder nodes remain | Critical | Grep for `core.logic.mock` |
| Entry points correctly defined | Warning | Check entry-points.json |
| Environment-specific values externalized | Warning | Check for hardcoded URLs/paths |
| Entry-point `uniqueId` values unique (duplicates block publishing) | Critical | Parse `entry-points.json` for duplicate `uniqueId` values |

> Do NOT execute the flow (`uip maestro flow debug` / `run`) during review — review is read-only. Runtime verification routes to `uipath-maestro-flow`.

## 11. Action Center / Human-in-the-Loop

For flows that create human tasks via Action Center:

### Task Design

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Actions have clear descriptions telling the user what to do and why | Warning | Review form task content |
| Data is pre-filled — ask only for the decision the automation cannot make | Warning | Check form pre-population |
| Deadlines configured on all human tasks (actions must not sit indefinitely) | Warning | Check deadline/SLA configuration |
| Escalation rules defined (auto-escalate to manager if unresponded) | Warning | Check escalation configuration |
| Assignment rules route actions to appropriate users/roles | Warning | Check task assignment logic |

### Long-Running Workflow Patterns

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| `Suspend` activity used to release robot while waiting (not `Delay` or loop-wait) | Critical | Grep for Wait/Delay patterns — should use Suspend |
| Timeout handling defined for unresponded actions | Warning | Check what happens if no one completes the task |
| Process state serializable (all variables must survive suspend/resume) | Critical | Check for non-serializable variable types |
| Robot is NOT held during human wait (process properly suspends) | Critical | Verify long-running workflow template is used |

### Maestro Orchestration Patterns

| Check | Severity | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Each task assigned to correct executor type (robot, agent, or human) | Warning | Review task executor assignments |
| Case management configured for individual case tracking | Info | Check case/instance management setup |
| Process Apps configured for user-initiated process starts | Info | Check if Process Apps are set up for business user access |
| End-to-end cycle time monitored (identify bottlenecks across actors) | Info | Check monitoring dashboards |
| Agent tasks have guardrails and fallback to human escalation | Warning | Review agent task configuration |
