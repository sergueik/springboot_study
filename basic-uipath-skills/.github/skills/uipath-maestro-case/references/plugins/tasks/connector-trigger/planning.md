# connector-trigger task — Planning

A connector-based trigger **inside a stage** — waits for an external event before continuing.

The planning pipeline is shared with the [event trigger](../../triggers/event/planning.md) — see [connector-trigger-planning.md](../../../connector-trigger-planning.md) for the full resolution pipeline (TypeCache lookup → connection pick → `case spec` discovery → reference resolution → required-field gate → SDD mapping → input-values + filter authoring).

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md describes a task that **suspends the stage until an external event fires**:

- "Wait until a new row appears in Salesforce"
- "Continue when a Slack reaction is added"
- "Suspend until an email arrives in Inbox"

Distinguish from:

- **Case-level event triggers** (start the case from outside) → [`plugins/triggers/event/`](../../triggers/event/planning.md)
- **Connector activity** (call out, don't wait) → [connector-activity](../connector-activity/planning.md)
- **Timer wait** (not connector-driven) → [wait-for-timer](../wait-for-timer/planning.md)

## Resolution Pipeline

Follow the pipeline in [connector-trigger-planning.md § Planning Pipeline](../../../connector-trigger-planning.md#planning-pipeline). All steps are identical for both in-stage triggers and case-level event triggers.

## tasks.md Entry Format

Populate `outputs:` using the shared [I/O-binding output-list contract](../../variables/io-binding/planning.md#canonical-tasksmd-output-list).

```markdown
## T<n>: Add connector-trigger task "<display-name>" to "<stage>"
- type-id: <uiPathActivityTypeId>
- connection-id: <connection-uuid>
- connector-key: <connectorKey>
- object-name: <objectName>
- event-operation: <eventOperation>
- event-mode: <polling|webhooks>
- input-values: {"eventParameters": {"parentFolderId": "AAMkADNm..."}}
- filter: {"groupOperator":"And","index":0,"uuId":null,"filters":[{"id":"subject","operator":"Contains","value":{"isLiteral":true,"rawString":"\"urgent\"","value":"urgent"},"uiId":null}]}
- outputs:                            # optional; omit only when the SDD declares none
  - <SDD output row, copied verbatim>
- isRequired: true
- runOnlyOnce: false
- activation-mode: event-triggered   # required; normally event-triggered for a connector event wait
- entry-rule: wait-for-connector   # required; must pair with activation-mode — see ../../conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md
- order: after T<m>
- lane: <n>
- verify: Confirm task created with correct event parameters
```

## Unresolved Fallback

Two entry paths: **Scenario A** — connector not found in TypeCache ([connector-trigger-planning.md § 1 No-match](../../../connector-trigger-planning.md#1-find-the-trigger-in-typecache), after the Rule 17 gate); **Scenario B** — connector found but connection unresolved, only after the create offer ([connector-trigger-planning.md § Resolve the connection](../../../connector-trigger-planning.md#2-resolve-the-connection)) is **declined** or fails. When `Connections` is empty, offer to create one first — do not jump straight here.

> **Rule 17 exception.** Empty `Connections` from `get-connection` (the connector trigger exists in typecache but no IS connection is registered) does NOT require the Rule 17 gate — proceed directly to placeholder.

If the connector or connection cannot be resolved:
- Mark `type-id` or `connection-id` with `<UNRESOLVED: reason>`
- Omit `input-values:` and `filter:`
- Execution creates a placeholder task (display-name + type only) per [placeholder-tasks.md](../../../placeholder-tasks.md)
