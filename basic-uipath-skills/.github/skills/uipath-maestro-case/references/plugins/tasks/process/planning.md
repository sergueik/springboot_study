# process task — Planning

An RPA-driven automated process task. Invokes a UiPath process (or agentic process) by name and folder.

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md describes a task as any of:

- `PROCESS` — a regular UiPath process
- `AGENTIC_PROCESS` — an agentic process orchestrated by UiPath
- Generic "run automation X" where X is a published process

For RPA robot tasks specifically, prefer [rpa](../rpa/planning.md). For Coded workflows / API-workflows, use [api-workflow](../api-workflow/planning.md).

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `display-name` | Task `Task Name` | Shown in the UI |
| `name` | Registry `selected.name` (NOT the sdd.md name) | Orchestrator release name — may differ from the project/package name. Becomes the `name` binding default and the right-hand segment of `resourceKey = <folder-path>.<name>`. |
| `folder-path` | Resolved registry `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName` (NOT the sdd.md "Folder") | This is the binding's `folderPath` default — Orchestrator starts the job here at runtime. The sdd.md "Folder" only seeds the registry lookup; it may be a parent/truncated path. See [§ Registry Resolution](#registry-resolution). |
| `task-type-id` | Registry resolution (see below) | Enables auto-enrichment via `tasks describe`. |
| `inputs` | sdd.md task data mapping | See [bindings-and-expressions.md](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md) |
| `outputs` | sdd.md task Outputs + `tasks describe` schema | Follow the shared [I/O-binding output-list contract](../../variables/io-binding/planning.md#canonical-tasksmd-output-list). |
| `runOnlyOnce` | sdd.md (default `false`) | Re-entry behavior comes from the SDD, not the task type.  |
| `isRequired` | sdd.md (default `true`) |  |

## Registry Resolution

1. **Primary cache file:** `processOrchestration-index.json` for both `PROCESS` and `AGENTIC_PROCESS`.
2. **Identifier field:** `entityKey`.
3. **Cross-type fallback — mandatory before unresolved fallback.** If the primary cache file has no exact match, query the *other* process cache with the same name and folder hint before recording `selected: null`, asking the empty-lookup question, or writing a placeholder. Therefore a `PROCESS` or `AGENTIC_PROCESS` miss in `processOrchestration-index.json` **MUST** be followed by a `process-index.json` lookup. The sdd.md label is not authoritative: a runnable process can be registered under either index. When the fallback matches, use that entry's `entityKey`, `name`, and full folder path, then continue to schema discovery — do not preserve the primary miss as an unresolved task.
4. **Match priority:** exact name + exact folder > exact name, multiple folders (pick matching) > exact name only > no match.
5. **`folder-path` = the SELECTED entry's `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName`** (not the sdd.md "Folder" — see the field table above). Fall back to the sdd.md folder only when there is no registry match (Unresolved path).
5a. **`name` = the SELECTED entry's `name`** (not the sdd.md name — the Orchestrator release name is what Orchestrator uses at runtime; it may differ from the package/project name). Record this as the `name` binding default; `resourceKey = <folder-path>.<name>`. Fall back to the sdd.md name only when there is no registry match.
6. **Discover inputs/outputs:** after resolving the `entityKey`, fetch the input/output schema via `tasks describe` — see [bindings-and-expressions.md § Discovering output names](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md). Record input names/types and validate outputs using the shared [I/O-binding output-list contract](../../variables/io-binding/planning.md#canonical-tasksmd-output-list). Unrecognized inputs in sdd.md → ask the user (**AskUserQuestion** with matching field names + "Something else").

## Unresolved Fallback

If no match is found across both cache files after `registry pull`:

- Mark the task line: `<UNRESOLVED: process "<name>" in folder "<folder>" not found in registry>`
- Omit `inputs:` and `outputs:`; capture intended wiring in a fenced ```` ```text ```` code block (not `#` prefixed — it renders as markdown H1).
- Continue planning for remaining tasks.
- Execution creates a placeholder task (empty `data: {}`, no bindings). See [placeholder-tasks.md](../../../placeholder-tasks.md).

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T<n>: Add process task "<display-name>" to "<stage>"
- name: "<resource-name>"
- taskTypeId: <entityKey>
- folder-path: "<folder>"
- inputs:
  - <input_name> = "<literal-or-expression>"
  - <input_name> <- "<Stage>"."<Task>".<output>
- outputs:
  - <SDD output row, copied verbatim>
- runOnlyOnce: false
- isRequired: true
- activation-mode: <sequential|parallel|event-triggered|adhoc|fan-in|conditional-gate>   # required
- entry-rule: <runs-sequentially|current-stage-entered|wait-for-connector|adhoc|selected-tasks-completed>   # required; must pair with activation-mode — see ../../conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md
- order: after T<m>
- lane: <n>  # structural/layout position only; sequencing is the task entry rule plus data.tasks order.
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture TaskId
```
