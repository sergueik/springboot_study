# stages — Planning

A stage node inside the case. Stages contain tasks and connect via entry/exit conditions (Rule 20). Two variants (`stage` and `secondary`) share the same plugin.

## Terminology

| Term | Same as |
|------|---------|
| Regular stage | `case-management:Stage` (default) |
| Secondary stage | `case-management:Stage` with `data.stageType: "secondary"` |

The only difference is `data.stageType`: omitted for a primary/regular stage (do NOT emit `"primary"`), `"secondary"` for a secondary stage; both use `type: case-management:Stage`. All other fields (label, description, entry/exit conditions, tasks, SLA) behave identically. Primary and secondary stages can both carry conditional + default `data.slaRules[]`.

The UI's **Secondary stage** toggle means an interrupting exception lane, not a second kind of primary flow stage. It is used for exception, rework, terminal, or special handling that moves the case out of the active primary path. Secondary stages cannot be connected to other stages as ordinary flow links, must not be required for `required-stages-completed`, and every secondary-stage entry condition must carry `Interrupting: Yes`. Optional work that does not interrupt the active path is an `adhoc` task or regular parallel path, not a secondary stage.

## When to Pick `secondary` vs `stage`

Use secondary (also "secondary stage") when the sdd.md describes any of:

- A handler for errors, escalations, or rejected items
- A rework / retry loop
- An on-error fallback
- A stage only reached via **interrupting** entry conditions
- A terminal or return lane that moves the case out of the active primary path
- Anything labeled "exception", "fallback", "on-error", or "secondary"

Otherwise default to a regular stage.

When ambiguous, use **AskUserQuestion** with both options + "Something else".

### Wiring constraints (reachability — edges retired)

No stage of either variant has edges. Reachability is expressed entirely through stage entry/exit conditions:

- **Regular stage** — reached via a **non-interrupting** entry condition: `case-entered` for the first stage, or `selected-stage-completed` / `selected-stage-exited` naming a predecessor. Every regular stage MUST have ≥1 entry condition, or it is orphaned and unreachable. See [stage-entry-conditions plugin](../conditions/stage-entry-conditions/planning.md).
- **Secondary stage** — reached via an **interrupting** entry condition. Global external events use one `wait-for-connector` entry; global case/stage SLA events that require case work use one `sla-status-change` entry (warning-only escalation stays a notification). Neither needs duplicated exit rules on every possible origin stage. Returning lanes exit via `return-to-origin`; terminal lanes exit via `exit-only` plus a case-exit row. See [stage-entry-conditions](../conditions/stage-entry-conditions/planning.md) and [stage-exit-conditions](../conditions/stage-exit-conditions/planning.md).

Do NOT create edges for any stage. If the sdd.md describes a stage "connected via an arrow / edge" to another, model it as the target stage's entry condition (plus a source-stage exit condition when the source diverges). Onward flow from a secondary stage uses `return-to-origin`, letting the origin stage's own entry/exit conditions carry the case forward.

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `label` | sdd.md stage name | Shown in the UI. |
| `type` | sdd.md intent | `stage` (default) or `secondary` — see above |
| `rationale` | sdd.md Design Rationale | Required reviewer context explaining the stage-kind and routing choice. A global-event secondary stage states why one interrupting entry replaces per-stage duplication. Not emitted into caseplan JSON. |
| `description` | sdd.md stage description | Optional. |
| `isRequired` | sdd.md (default `true` for regular, `false` for secondary) | **Planning-only metadata.** See note below. |

### Note on `isRequired`

`isRequired` is written into the stage node's `data.isRequired` and is consumed downstream by case exit conditions with `rule-type: required-stages-completed` — the case completes when all stages flagged `isRequired: true` have completed.

Record `isRequired` in `tasks.md` for each stage. Use:
- `true` — **Default for regular stages.** Stage is on the main flow path and must complete for case completion.
- `false` — **Default for secondary stages.** Secondary / fallback / rework / terminal stages only reached via interrupting entry conditions.

Implementation phase consumes this value when adding case-exit-conditions; the stage itself is created without it.

## Registry Resolution

**None.** Stages have no registry representation — no `taskTypeId`, no enrichment.

## Auto-Positioning

Stage position is auto-computed by the impl-json recipe: `x = 100 + (existingStageCount * 500), y = 200`. The planning entry does not carry coordinates unless the sdd.md specifies explicit ones.

## Ordering

Stages are created **after** the root case (T01) and **before** any tasks or conditions reference them. Each stage write produces a `StageId` — capture it in the planning/execution capture map. Downstream T-entries (tasks, conditions, SLA) use the stage **name** in `tasks.md`; the implementation phase resolves the name to the captured `StageId`.

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T<n>: Create stage "<label>"
- type: stage
- rationale: "<why this is a primary stage and how it is reached/exited>"
- description: "<description from sdd.md>"
- isRequired: <true|false from sdd.md; false if unspecified>
- order: after T<m>
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture StageId
```

Secondary variant:

```markdown
## T<n>: Create secondary stage "<label>"
- type: secondary
- rationale: "<why this is interrupting and which global/conditional event it handles>"
- description: "<description from sdd.md>"
- isRequired: <true|false from sdd.md; false if unspecified>
- order: after T<m>
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture StageId
```

## Unresolved Fallback

Stages have no registry lookup, so there is no "unresolved" path. If the sdd.md is missing stage names or descriptions, ask the user with **AskUserQuestion** rather than proceeding with placeholders.
