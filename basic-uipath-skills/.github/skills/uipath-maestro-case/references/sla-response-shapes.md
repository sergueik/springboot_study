# SLA Response Shapes

Canonical rules for turning an SLA at-risk / breach event into case behavior. Single source of truth — SKILL.md Rule 21, [sdd-generation-rules.md § SLA response model](sdd-generation-rules.md), [brownfield.md § SLA responses](brownfield.md#sla-responses-in-a-brownfield-edit), and the SLA / condition / task plugins all link here instead of restating it.

An SLA **clock** ([plugins/sla/impl-json.md](plugins/sla/impl-json.md)) and its **response** are separate authoring decisions. Read the response off the requirement — never off the SLA's scope.

## 1. Pick the response

| Response | Source says | What you author |
|---|---|---|
| `notify-only` | notify / alert / email / page someone, nothing more | an escalation on the target's `slaRules[].escalationRule`. **No** stage, task, or condition. |
| `start-task` | follow-up work inside the **same** breached stage — "as part of the review", "the reviewer keeps working and also does X", a named task for a manager or peer | one task in the breached stage whose **own** entry condition is the `sla-status-change` rule (§3) |
| `enter-stage` | a separate lane owns it — "hand it to", "escalate into `<Lane>`", ownership change, recovery, a visible lifecycle step | a separate stage carrying the `sla-status-change` entry condition |
| `exit-stage` | the breached stage should end, fail, or route away | a stage-exit row |
| `exit-case` | the case should close, cancel, fail, or reach an alternate terminal outcome | a `metadata.caseExitRules[]` row |

**Default:** absent a stated response, at-risk and breached are both `notify-only`. Never invent a stage, task, or routing change for a requirement that only asks to notify someone.

**`start-task` vs `enter-stage` turns on WHERE the work lives — not on whether it interrupts.** `enter-stage` can itself be non-interrupting, so "the team keeps working" does not choose between them. A named **task** ("raise a Senior Assessor Check approval") never justifies a new stage: if the target you are about to write is a task name rather than a lane the source describes in its own right, the response is `start-task`, and the task goes in the breached stage.

## 2. Status rides on the escalation reference

| Status | Rule fields | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Breached | `slaId` only — an **absent `escalationId` is the persisted representation of Breached** | nothing else; a breach response needs no escalation to exist |
| At-risk | `slaId` + a concrete `escalationId` | that escalation must be declared **on the same SLA** and have `triggerInfo.type: "at-risk"` |

Never author the Case Designer's `"any"` escalation sentinel.

## 3. Where the rule lives

`sla-status-change` is legal on **task entry** and on **stage entry** (both validate — see § Verified below):

- **`start-task`** — put the rule on the follow-up **task's** `entryConditions`, referencing the breached stage's own SLA. The task fires on the SLA event itself: no stage re-entry, no re-run of the stage's other tasks. It is the **only** authorable `start-task` shape.
- **`enter-stage`** — put the rule on the destination **stage's** `entryConditions`.

**Never author `start-task` as a stage-entry rule on the breached stage.** `validate` accepts it, but stage re-entry restarts every task in that stage whose `shouldRunOnlyOnce` is `false` — the default for every task type — so a breach meant to add one manager check silently re-runs the whole stage. This is defect 4 in §5.

Rule JSON, per-scope emit details, and post-write checks: [plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/impl-json.md § sla-status-change](plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/impl-json.md) (stage scope) and [plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/impl-json.md](plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/impl-json.md) (task scope).

## 4. Interrupting

`isInterrupting` follows what the response does to **active work**, never the SLA's scope:

- `true` — the response stops, pauses, takes over, or reroutes work in flight.
- `false` — the response runs alongside work that continues (parallel oversight).

`isInterrupting` is a property of a **stage-entry** condition, so it applies to `enter-stage` only. A `start-task` response is a task-entry rule and has no interrupting cell at all — render `—`.

**A non-interrupting SLA lane is still a secondary stage.** Keep `stageType: "secondary"` and `isRequired: false`; do NOT convert it to a regular stage to satisfy "every secondary-stage entry is interrupting" — a regular stage joins the main flow and, when required, gates case completion. In `sdd.md`, the stage-level `Interrupting` field and that entry row must agree; `Yes` on the stage with `No` on its only entry row is a blocking render error.

## 5. Four defects `validate` cannot see

It passes on all four, so they are on the author:

1. **A task with no entry condition never starts.** `validate` accepts `entryConditions: []` and even a missing key. Every task added for a `start-task` response carries its own entry condition (§3).
2. **A non-interrupting lane emitted as a regular stage** (§4) — silently changes the completion contract.
3. **`escalationId: "any"` repaired by repointing.** Removing the key is the fix; substituting a concrete escalation also turns `validate` green but converts a Breached rule into an at-risk rule — a behavior change the user never asked for. The same conversion happens when a correct breach rule is "completed" by adding an escalation because a checklist looked like it required one: a breach rule carrying only `slaId` is finished, not missing a field.
4. **`start-task` authored as stage re-entry** (§3) — re-runs every `shouldRunOnlyOnce: false` task in the breached stage, not just the follow-up.

## Verified

Probed with `uip maestro case validate` on **uip 1.198.0-preview.102** (2026-07-31):

| Shape | Result |
|---|---|
| breach on a separate stage (`slaId` only), `isInterrupting` `true` / `false` | valid / valid |
| breach as a **stage-entry** rule on the breached stage's own SLA, `isInterrupting` `true` / `false` | valid / valid — but **never author this**: it is defect 4 (§5), invisible to the CLI |
| breach / at-risk on a **task's** `entryConditions` (stage SLA and root SLA) | valid |
| at-risk with an escalation declared on that SLA | valid |
| at-risk borrowing another SLA's escalation | **invalid** — "The escalation referenced by rule … no longer exists" |
| `escalationId: "any"` | **invalid** — same error |
| dangling `slaId` | **invalid** — "The SLA referenced by rule … no longer exists" |
| task with `entryConditions: []` or the key absent | valid (defect is invisible to the CLI) |
