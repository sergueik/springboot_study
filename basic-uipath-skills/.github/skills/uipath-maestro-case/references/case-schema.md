# Case Management JSON Schema — Cross-Cutting Reference

Structural reference for the case definition JSON. Shared across all node types. Per-task-type and per-condition-type field shapes live in each plugin's `impl-json.md`.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "id": "case-aBcDeFgHiJ",
  "version": "27.0.0",
  "name": "<case name>",
  "description": "<optional>",
  "metadata": {
    "caseIdentifier": "<MORT>",
    "caseIdentifierType": "constant",
    "caseAppEnabled": false,
    "publishVersion": 2,
    "caseUnifiedSchemaEnabled": true,
    "caseDirectlyPassTaskOutputs": true,
    "intsvcActivityConfig": "v2",
    "slaRules": [ ... ],
    "caseExitRules": [ ... ]
  },
  "bindings": [ ... ],
  "variables": { "inputs": [], "outputs": [], "inputOutputs": [] },
  "nodes": [ ... ],
  "edges": [],
  "layout": {}
}
```

### Layout-strip (Rule 18)

Node-level layout fields move to a top-level `layout` block. The frontend transformer `transformCaseInMemoryJsonToDiskJson.ts` does this stripping when round-tripping through canvas; skill emits clean nodes from the start.

**Stripped from each node** (skill MUST NOT emit):
- `position`
- `style`
- `measured`
- `width`
- `height`
- `zIndex`

**Stripped from each edge** (skill MUST NOT emit):
- `data.waypoints`

**Lifted to** `layout.nodes[<nodeId>] = { position, style, measured, width, height }` and `layout.edges[<edgeId>] = { waypoints }` — but skill emits empty `layout: {}` because FE auto-layouts on canvas load. Skill is not a layout authority.

---

**ID format (cross-cutting).** All generated IDs follow the CLI's `prefixedId(prefix, count)` scheme: a fixed prefix followed by `count` random characters from `[A-Za-z0-9]`. Direct-JSON-write must use the same format — the frontend's `generateNextId(prefix, count)` depends on it.

| Entity | Prefix | Suffix length | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage (primary + secondary) | `Stage_` | 6 | `Stage_aB3kL9` |
| Trigger (added after initial) | `trigger_` | 6 | `trigger_xY2mNp` |
| Task | `t` | 8 | `t8GQTYo8O` |
| Task entry condition | `c` | 8 | `c4fGhJ2Mn` |
| Task entry rule | `r` | 8 | `rK9xQw3Lp` |
| Stage/case/task condition | `Condition_` | 6 | `Condition_xC1XyX` |
| Rule inside those conditions | `Rule_` | 6 | `Rule_jdBFrJ` |
| Sticky note | `StickyNote_` | 6 | `StickyNote_aBcDeF` |
| SLA rule entry | `sla` | 8 | `sla7bK2mNp9` |
| SLA escalation | `esc_` | 6 | `esc_gH2jKl` |
| Binding | `b` | 8 | `b3KmNp7Q9` |

---

## 1. Top-level + metadata

Metadata and configuration for the case definition. Top-level fields (`id`, `version`, `name`, `description`) sit alongside the `metadata` block.

```json
{
  "id": "case-aBcDeFgHiJ",
  "version": "27.0.0",
  "name": "Loan Approval",
  "description": "case description",
  "metadata": {
    "caseIdentifier": "LOAN",
    "caseIdentifierType": "constant",
    "caseAppEnabled": false,
    "publishVersion": 2,
    "caseUnifiedSchemaEnabled": true,
    "caseDirectlyPassTaskOutputs": true,
    "intsvcActivityConfig": "v2",
    "slaRules": [
      { "id": "slaQ4wZ1xC8", "displayName": "Default", "expression": "=js:true", "count": 5, "unit": "d" }
    ],
    "caseExitRules": []
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique ID, `case-` + 10 random chars (auto-generated) |
| `version` | string | Schema version — `"27.0.0"`. Emitted by the `case` plugin at T01. |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name |
| `description` | string? | Case description |
| `metadata.caseIdentifier` | string | Runtime identifier. `constant` → literal prefix. `external` → `=`-prefixed expression. See § Case identifier below. |
| `metadata.caseIdentifierType` | `"constant"` \| `"external"` | Selects how `caseIdentifier` is read. Default `constant`. |
| `metadata.caseAppEnabled` | boolean | Whether the Case App UI is enabled |
| `metadata.publishVersion` | number? | Publish version — `2` for current schema |
| `metadata.caseUnifiedSchemaEnabled` | boolean? | Unified-schema flag (`true`) |
| `metadata.caseDirectlyPassTaskOutputs` | boolean? | Passes task outputs directly through messages instead of shared variables, fixing race conditions on task outputs in cases with parallel tasks. Schema-optional, defaults `true` when absent; skill emits the T01 `directly-pass-task-outputs` value (`true` unless sdd.md requested `false`). |
| `metadata.intsvcActivityConfig` | string? | Integration-service activity configuration payload |
| `metadata.slaRules` | SlaRuleEntry[]? | Conditional + default SLA rules for the case. Every rule has a non-empty target-unique `displayName` without `:`; default SLA lives here as the trailing entry with `expression: "=js:true"`. Escalations attach inside each rule's `escalationRule[]`. See §6. |
| `metadata.caseExitRules` | CaseExitCondition[]? | Conditions that mark the case as complete |

### Case identifier (constant vs external)

`caseIdentifierType` picks how `caseIdentifier` resolves at runtime:

- **`constant`** (default) — `caseIdentifier` is a literal 2-4 char prefix (`"LOAN"`). Runtime emits the case external id as `<prefix>-<generated>`.
- **`external`** — `caseIdentifier` is a `=`-prefixed expression (bare `=vars.<id>` or `=js:<expr>`). Runtime evaluates it; the result becomes the case external id verbatim (no prefix). Same `=vars.<id>` / `=js:` convention as [bindings-and-expressions.md](bindings-and-expressions.md) — no other engine. Field lives under `metadata`. Authoring forms + variable eligibility: [`plugins/case/planning.md` § External identifier value](plugins/case/planning.md).

### CaseExitCondition

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "displayName": "Case resolved",
  "rules": [],
  "marksCaseComplete": true
}
```

Rule structure uses DNF — see §4.

`marksCaseComplete` is the case-close bit, not a stage-completion bit. A valid case has at least one root `metadata.caseExitRules[]` entry with `marksCaseComplete: true` (normally `required-stages-completed`). Entries with `marksCaseComplete: false` describe non-completing exits and must not be the only case-exit rules.

---

## 2. nodes (three types, discriminated on `type`)

### a) Trigger Node — `"uipath.case.trigger"`

Entry point. Written by the triggers plugin at T02. Exactly one per case (single-trigger cases); additional triggers use the `trigger_` ID prefix.

```json
{
  "id": "trigger_xY2mNp",
  "type": "uipath.case.trigger",
  "data": {
    "typeVersion": "1.0.0",
    "display": { "label": "Start" },
    "inputs": { "serviceType": "None" }
  }
}
```

No `position`, `style`, `measured`, `width`, `zIndex`, or `parentElement` on Trigger nodes (Rule 18 layout-strip).

**`data` shape (v24 manifest layout).** The label lives under `data.display.label`; all runtime config (`serviceType`, `timerType`, `timeCycle`, `context[]`, `inputs[]`, `outputs[]`, `bindings[]`) lives under `data.inputs`. `data.typeVersion` is the literal `"1.0.0"`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `typeVersion` | string | Manifest type version — literal `"1.0.0"`. |
| `display` | `{ label?, icon? }` ? | Presentation. `display.label` is the trigger's display name (was `data.label` pre-v24). |
| `inputs` | object? | Runtime config bag (passthrough). Holds `serviceType` plus per-kind fields. Absent on a manual trigger. |
| `description` | string? | Free-text description — stays at `data.description` (only `label` moved to `display`). |

`data.inputs.serviceType` values: `"None"`, `"Intsvc.EventTrigger"`, `"timer"`. The specific binding/config shape for each trigger kind lives in the corresponding trigger plugin's `impl-json.md`.

> **Placeholder form (`Intsvc.EventTrigger` only):** when an event trigger's IS connection is unresolved, `data.inputs` carries `serviceType` only — no `context[]`, `metadata`, `inputs[]`, `outputs[]`, or `bindings[]`. See [`triggers/event/impl-json.md` § Placeholder fallback](plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md).

### b) Stage Node — `"case-management:Stage"`

Workflow stage. Contains tasks. Covers BOTH primary and secondary stages — discriminated by `data.stageType` (see §2c for the secondary variant). A primary stage omits `stageType`; a secondary stage sets `data.stageType: "secondary"`.

```json
{
  "id": "Stage_aB3kL9",
  "type": "case-management:Stage",
  "data": {
    "label": "Review Application",
    "description": "...",
    "isRequired": false,
    "parentElement": { "id": "root", "type": "case-management:root" },
    "isInvalidDropTarget": false,
    "isPendingParent": false,
    "tasks": [ [ { "...": "task" } ] ],
    "slaRules": [
      { "id": "sla3kL9mNpQ", "displayName": "Default", "expression": "=js:true", "count": 2, "unit": "d" }
    ]
  }
}
```

No `position`, `style`, `measured`, `width`, `height`, or `zIndex` at the node level (Rule 18 layout-strip).

**`StageNodeData` fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `stageType` | `"primary" \| "secondary"` ? | Stage kind discriminator. Omitted on a primary stage (do NOT emit `"primary"`); set to `"secondary"` for a secondary stage, where it is the FIRST field in `data` (before `label`). See §2c. |
| `label` | string? | Display label; required, unique across stages, and must not contain `:` |
| `description` | string? | Stage description |
| `isRequired` | boolean? | Whether the stage must complete before case exit (used by case-exit rule `required-stages-completed`) |
| `parentElement` | `{id,type}` | Always `{ id: "root", type: "case-management:root" }`. The literal `"root"` is canvas-side — there is no `"root"` node on disk. |
| `isInvalidDropTarget` | boolean | Always `false` (UI drag-drop flag) |
| `isPendingParent` | boolean | Always `false` (UI drag-drop flag) |
| `tasks` | Task[][] | 2D structural array. Preserve the task order used by the frontend. A strict sequential chain is consecutive single-task inner arrays (`[[A], [B], [C]]`) plus `runs-sequentially` on each task. Intentionally parallel siblings share an inner array, either at stage start (`[[A, B], [C]]`) or after an immediate predecessor (`[[A], [B, C], [D]]` with `runs-sequentially` on B and C). Empty array `[]` when no tasks yet. |
| `slaRules` | SlaRuleEntry[]? | Conditional + default SLA rules for this stage. Every rule has a non-empty target-unique `displayName` without `:`; default SLA is the trailing `"=js:true"` entry. Escalations nest inside each rule. See §6. |
| `entryConditions` | EntryCondition[]? | See §3. Not initialized on primary Stage creation — added later by the conditions plugins. (A secondary stage initializes these at creation — see §2c.) |
| `exitConditions` | ExitCondition[]? | See §3. Not initialized on primary Stage creation — added later by the conditions plugins. (A secondary stage initializes these at creation — see §2c.) |
| `instanceIdPrefix` | string? | Prefix for instance IDs |

> **A primary `Stage` is created without `entryConditions`/`exitConditions`.** Match this by not emitting empty arrays for those fields when writing a primary stage. They are added later by the condition plugins when entry/exit conditions are written. (A secondary stage — `data.stageType: "secondary"` — initializes both to `[]` at creation; see §2c.) See §3 for the condition shapes. Transitions are driven entirely by these conditions (Rule 20, §4).

### c) Secondary (Exception) Stage — `case-management:Stage` with `data.stageType: "secondary"`

Not a distinct node type. A secondary stage is a Stage node (§2b) with `data.stageType: "secondary"`. Same top-level and render fields as a primary Stage. Adds `entryConditions`, `exitConditions` initialized at creation time. The literal node type `case-management:ExceptionStage` is removed at schema v22 and MUST NOT be emitted.

```json
{
  "id": "Stage_cD4mNt",
  "type": "case-management:Stage",
  "data": {
    "stageType": "secondary",
    "label": "Handle Rejection",
    "parentElement": { "id": "root", "type": "case-management:root" },
    "isInvalidDropTarget": false,
    "isPendingParent": false,
    "tasks": [],
    "entryConditions": [],
    "exitConditions": []
  }
}
```

**Secondary-stage init on `StageNodeData`:** a secondary stage initializes these at creation (a primary stage omits them — see §2b):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `entryConditions` | EntryCondition[] | Initialized to `[]` on create; see §3 |
| `exitConditions` | ExitCondition[] | Initialized to `[]` on create; see §3 |

> **SLA on a secondary Stage (`data.stageType: "secondary"`)** — the runtime accepts `slaRules[]` on a secondary Stage the same way it does on a primary Stage. Author per [`plugins/sla/impl-json.md`](plugins/sla/impl-json.md).

### d) Sticky Note Node — `"case-management:StickyNote"`

Free-floating annotation node. Ignored at execution time; surfaced only in the authoring canvas.

```json
{
  "id": "<shortId>",
  "type": "case-management:StickyNote",
  "position": { "x": 400, "y": 400 },
  "data": {
    "label": "Note",
    "color": "yellow",
    "content": "Reminder: confirm SLA with ops before publishing."
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data.label` | string? | Display label |
| `data.color` | string? | Sticky note color |
| `data.content` | string? | Note body |

---

## 3. Conditions (cross-cutting)

All conditions share the same shape but attach at different levels. Per-level field tables and `--rule-type` semantics live in the corresponding condition plugin's `impl-json.md`.

### EntryCondition (stage-level)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string? | Unique ID |
| `displayName` | string? | Human-readable label |
| `rules` | Rules | DNF rule set — see §4 |
| `isInterrupting` | boolean? | Whether the condition interrupts the current stage |

### ExitCondition (stage-level)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string? | Unique ID |
| `displayName` | string? | Human-readable label |
| `rules` | Rules | DNF rule set — see §4 |
| `type` | string? | `"exit-only"` \| `"wait-for-user"` \| `"return-to-origin"` |
| `exitToStageId` | string? | Target stage ID when routing to a specific stage |
| `marksStageComplete` | boolean? | Whether this exit marks the stage complete |

### TaskEntryCondition (task-level)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string? | Unique ID |
| `displayName` | string? | Human-readable label |
| `rules` | Rules | DNF rule set — see §4 |

### CaseExitCondition (case-level)

See `metadata.caseExitRules` in §1.

---

## 4. edges — retired, always `[]`

**The skill never authors edges (Rule 20).** `schema.edges` stays `[]` — the empty array remains in the schema for frontend compatibility. Stage transitions derive entirely from `entryConditions` / `exitConditions` (§3); the case start derives from the first stage's `case-entered` entry condition, not a `TriggerEdge`. The FE auto-derives canvas connectors from the conditions.

A canvas-round-tripped file may contain FE-materialized edge objects. Treat them as read-only — never copy, adapt, or author one; model flow with conditions (§3) instead. Stray-edge removal: [case-editing-operations.md § Delete an edge](case-editing-operations.md#delete-an-edge--defensive-only). Shapes for READING such files: [Appendix — Edge shapes](#appendix--edge-shapes-read-only--never-author).

---

## 5. Rules (DNF — OR of AND-clauses)

Used by every condition type (entry, exit, task-entry, case-exit).

```
Rules = Rule[][]
  Outer array = OR groups
  Inner array = AND conditions within a group
```

### Rule types (cross-cutting catalog)

| `rule` | Additional fields | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| `wait-for-connector` | `id?`, `uipath` (connector config — **required**; absent → `connector activity missing`. Unresolved → **stub** placeholder, not bare — see § Placeholder fallback), `conditionExpression?` | Wait for an external connector event — see § Connector-bound rule below |
| `case-entered` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | Fires when the case is first entered |
| `selected-stage-completed` | `id?`, `selectedStageId?`, `conditionExpression?` | A specific stage has completed |
| `selected-stage-exited` | `id?`, `selectedStageId?`, `conditionExpression?` | A specific stage has been exited |
| `selected-tasks-completed` | `id?`, `selectedTasksIds?`, `conditionExpression?` | Specific tasks have all completed |
| `required-tasks-completed` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | All required tasks in the stage have completed |
| `required-stages-completed` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | All required stages have completed |
| `current-stage-entered` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | The current stage was just entered |
| `user-selected-stage` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | Fires when a user manually selects/routes to this stage |
| `sla-status-change` | `id?`, `slaId?`, `escalationId?`, `conditionExpression?` | Fires when the referenced case/stage SLA breaches (`slaId` alone — an absent `escalationId` is the persisted Breached shape), or reaches the referenced at-risk escalation (`slaId` + that SLA's at-risk `escalationId`); stage-entry scope (`enter-stage`) and task-entry scope (`start-task`) |
| `adhoc` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | Ad-hoc expression-based condition |
| `runs-sequentially` | `id?`, `conditionExpression?` | Sequential tasks run in the order they appear in the stage from top to bottom | 

At task level, the frontend's manually-triggered/adhoc mode is represented by an `adhoc`-only entry condition and `isRequired: false`; it is not an event rule. External event mode uses an explicit event rule such as `wait-for-connector`; it is not implied by task order or lane placement.

Not every rule type is valid at every level — see each condition plugin's `impl-json.md` for the allowed subset per location.

```json
{ "rule": "case-entered", "id": "<id>" }
{ "rule": "selected-stage-completed", "id": "<id>", "selectedStageId": "<stageId>" }
{ "rule": "selected-tasks-completed", "id": "<id>", "selectedTasksIds": ["<taskId1>", "<taskId2>"] }
{ "rule": "sla-status-change", "id": "<id>", "slaId": "<slaId>", "escalationId": "<escalationId>" }
{ "rule": "adhoc", "id": "<id>", "conditionExpression": "=js:vars.score > 700" }
```

An interrupting secondary-stage `sla-status-change` entry is global to the referenced SLA scope: it can exit whichever covered stage is active. Do not pair it with duplicated per-stage exit rules.

### Connector-bound `wait-for-connector` rule

A `wait-for-connector` rule binds an IS connector trigger under **`uipath`** — the same block the in-stage `wait-for-connector` task carries under `data`. A bare rule (no `uipath`) is rejected by Studio Web (the FE validator requires the connector activity to resolve). It is authored from a `case spec --type trigger` scaffold; the CLI does not bind it (`buildRule` emits the bare form). `conditionExpression` is an optional `=js:` gate on **case state** (`vars.X` / `metadata`) — NOT the event payload (no `event` namespace). Inputs/outputs `elementId` = `<stageId>-<ruleId>` (stage-entry / stage-exit / task-entry — all stage-scoped) or `root-<ruleId>` (case-exit). Full recipe: [connector-trigger-impl.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule](connector-trigger-impl.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule).

```json
{
  "rule": "wait-for-connector",
  "id": "<ruleId>",
  "uipath": {
    "serviceType": "Intsvc.WaitForEvent",
    "context": [ { "name": "connectorKey", "value": "<key>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "connection", "value": "=bindings.<id>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "resourceKey", "value": "<connection-id>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "folderKey", "value": "=bindings.<id>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "method", "value": "<httpMethod>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "path", "value": "<path>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "objectName", "value": "<object>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "operation", "value": "<eventOperation>", "type": "string" }, { "name": "metadata", "type": "json", "body": { } } ],
    "inputs": [ ],
    "outputs": [ ],
    "bindings": []
  },
  "conditionExpression": "=js:<optional case-state gate, e.g. vars.X — NOT the event payload>"
}
```

> Full `validate` requires `rule.uipath` + `context` (absent → `connector activity missing`); the check is satisfied by `context` entries named `connectorKey` + `operation`, and does not inspect internals (a wrong `serviceType` passes). Confirm the connector resolves via Studio Web. The exact `context` field set is CLI-emitted and varies by connector — splice it verbatim from `case spec`; the 9 fields above are illustrative of an HTTP-event connector, not a fixed schema.

---

## 6. SLA and Escalation

All SLA data on a target (root or stage) lives in a single `slaRules[]` array. The default SLA is the trailing entry with `expression: "=js:true"`; conditional overrides sit before it in priority order. Escalations nest inside each rule's `escalationRule[]`.

```json
"slaRules": [
  {
    "id": "sla_Ur7pL2Qx",
    "displayName": "Urgent SLA",
    "expression": "=js:vars.priority === 'Urgent'",
    "count": 30,
    "unit": "min",
    "escalationRule": [
      {
        "id": "esc_aB3kL9",
        "displayName": "Urgent SLA breached",
        "triggerInfo": { "type": "sla-breached" },
        "action": {
          "type": "notification",
          "recipients": [
            { "scope": "User", "target": "<user-uuid>", "value": "manager@corp.com" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "sla_Df4nV8Ks",
    "displayName": "Default SLA",
    "expression": "=js:true",
    "count": 5,
    "unit": "d",
    "escalationRule": [
      {
        "id": "esc_xY2mNp",
        "displayName": "Notify manager",
        "triggerInfo": { "type": "at-risk", "atRiskPercentage": 80 },
        "action": {
          "type": "notification",
          "recipients": [
            { "scope": "User", "target": "<user-uuid>", "value": "manager@corp.com" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Time units: `"min"` (minutes), `"h"` (hours), `"d"` (days), `"w"` (weeks), `"m"` (months).
Escalation `triggerInfo.type`: `"at-risk"` or `"sla-breached"`. `atRiskPercentage` is required when `type === "at-risk"` and omitted otherwise.
Escalation `action.recipients[].scope`: `"User"` or `"UserGroup"`. `target` is the user / group UUID; `value` is the display string (email or group name).
Escalation `id` and `displayName` are both **required** (as of schema v27). Default `displayName` format: `Escalation rule <N> - <sla displayName>`.

### SlaRuleEntry

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Stable `sla_` identifier. Required when a `sla-status-change` rule references this SLA. |
| `displayName` | string | Required, target-unique SLA title; must not contain `:`. |
| `expression` | string | Rule predicate. `"=js:true"` marks the default / fallback rule. Non-default rules require a non-empty expression. |
| `count` | number? | SLA duration count (optional — a bare escalation-only rule may omit this). |
| `unit` | `"min" \| "h" \| "d" \| "w" \| "m"` ? | SLA duration unit (optional — paired with `count`). |
| `escalationRule` | EscalationRule[]? | Notifications to fire at-risk or on breach. Each escalation requires a non-empty target-unique `displayName` without `:`, at least one recipient, and an at-risk percentage when its trigger type is `at-risk`. Runtime attaches escalations to whichever rule is active. |

Evaluated in array order; the first truthy expression wins. The trailing `"=js:true"` entry acts as the default.

> **SLA capabilities** — escalation rules can attach to any rule (not only the default `"=js:true"`). `slaRules[]` is supported on a secondary Stage (`data.stageType: "secondary"`). A single `EscalationRule` may carry multiple `recipients[]`. See [`plugins/sla/impl-json.md`](plugins/sla/impl-json.md).

---

## 7. Tasks — BaseTask shape (shared)

All tasks inside a stage share this envelope. Per-type `data` fields live in each task plugin's `impl-json.md`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique task ID, `t` + 8 random chars (e.g. `t8GQTYo8O`) |
| `elementId` | string | Composite `${stageId}-${taskId}` (e.g. `Stage_aB3kL9-t8GQTYo8O`) |
| `displayName` | string? | Human-readable label shown in the UI |
| `type` | string | Task type — see task plugins under `plugins/tasks/` |
| `data` | object | Type-specific configuration — see corresponding plugin's `impl-json.md`. For connector tasks, `data.bindings` references the root-level bindings array. |
| `skipCondition` | string? | `=js:` expression — skip the task when truthy. Use strict equality ([`bindings-and-expressions.md`](bindings-and-expressions.md#equality-operators)). |
| `entryConditions` | TaskEntryCondition[]? | See §3. Written by the task-entry-conditions plugin from the SDD's authored Entry Condition rows — applied uniformly across task types (no auto-injection by task type). |
| `shouldRunOnlyOnce` | boolean? | Run the task at most once per case, even if the stage is re-entered |
| `shouldRunOnReEntry` | boolean? | *(deprecated — use `shouldRunOnlyOnce`)* Re-run when stage is re-entered |
| `isRequired` | boolean? | Whether the task must complete for the stage to complete |
| `description` | string? | Task description |

> **Envelope fields are top-level, not `data`.** Every field above except `data` lives directly on the task object — `skipCondition`, `entryConditions`, `shouldRunOnlyOnce`, `isRequired`, etc. are siblings of `data`, never nested inside it. `data` holds only the type-specific config defined by the task's plugin. An envelope field misplaced inside `data` passes `validate` silently (extra `data` keys aren't rejected) but is dead config the platform never reads.
>

**Positioning:** tasks have no `x`/`y`. They live in the stage's `data.tasks` 2D structural array. Do not infer execution order from lane-sharing alone. For a strict sequential chain, preserve declaration order as consecutive single-task sets and put `runs-sequentially` as the only entry rule on each task in the chain. For independent siblings after one predecessor, place those siblings in the same next task set and put `runs-sequentially` on each sibling.

**Task type catalog** (full shape in each plugin's `impl-json.md`):

| Task `type` | Plugin |
|-------------|--------|
| `process` | `plugins/tasks/process/` |
| `action` | `plugins/tasks/action/` |
| `agent` | `plugins/tasks/agent/` |
| `rpa` | `plugins/tasks/rpa/` |
| `api-workflow` | `plugins/tasks/api-workflow/` |
| `case-management` | `plugins/tasks/case-management/` |
| `execute-connector-activity` | `plugins/tasks/connector-activity/` |
| `wait-for-connector` | `plugins/tasks/connector-trigger/` |
| `wait-for-timer` | `plugins/tasks/wait-for-timer/` |

> **Not supported yet — do NOT author.** `external-agent`, `external-workflow`, `document-extraction`, `flow-process`. None of these are valid in `caseplan.json` (SKILL.md Rule 16).

## Appendix — Edge shapes (read-only — never author)

> **Read-only reference (Rule 20 — edges retired).** Documented ONLY so a canvas-round-tripped file (where the FE may have materialized edges) is still readable. Never copy these into a build or write an edge object into `caseplan.json` — see §4.

### a) TriggerEdge — `"case-management:TriggerEdge"`

Connects Trigger → Stage. No rules.

```json
{
  "id": "edge_Qz7hVr",
  "type": "case-management:TriggerEdge",
  "source": "trigger_xY2mNp",
  "target": "Stage_aB3kL9",
  "sourceHandle": "trigger_xY2mNp____source____right",
  "targetHandle": "Stage_aB3kL9____target____left",
  "data": { "label": "Start" }
}
```

### b) Edge — `"case-management:Edge"`

Connects Stage → Stage. Transition conditions live on the source stage's `exitConditions`, not on the edge.

```json
{
  "id": "edge_pK2mLq",
  "type": "case-management:Edge",
  "source": "Stage_aB3kL9",
  "target": "Stage_cD4mNt",
  "sourceHandle": "Stage_aB3kL9____source____right",
  "targetHandle": "Stage_cD4mNt____target____left",
  "data": { "label": "Approved" }
}
```

**Handle format:** `<nodeId>____source____<direction>` or `<nodeId>____target____<direction>` — exactly **four underscores** on each side of `source` / `target`. Directions: `right`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`.

**Type discriminator when reading:** Trigger source → `TriggerEdge`; Stage source → `Edge`. **`zIndex`** (number, optional) may appear.

`edges` is empty: the skill authors no edges. The case starts because `Stage_aB3kL9` carries a `case-entered` entry condition (added by the stage-entry-conditions plugin), not because a `TriggerEdge` connects the trigger to it.
