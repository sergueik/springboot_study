# Phases 2–6 — Execution: tasks.md → caseplan.json

Execute the `tasks.md` plan, building `caseplan.json` via direct JSON edits per plugin. Validate, then optionally publish and debug. Five phases: **Phase 2 Prototyping** → **Phase 3 Implementation** → **Phase 4 Validate** → **Phase 5 Publish** → **Phase 6 Debug**.

> **Editing an existing case?** Targeted edits to an existing `caseplan.json` skip this execution pipeline — see [brownfield.md](brownfield.md).

> **Prerequisite:** [Phase 1 Planning](planning.md) produced `tasks.md`. Phase 1 auto-proceeds into execution (plan treated as approved) — it stops before Phase 2 only when the request explicitly asked for a plan-only / review-first run.
>
> **Input:** `tasks/tasks.md` — the complete handoff artifact.

> **Five phases follow planning.** Execution splits into **Phase 2 — Prototyping** (reviewable preview: structure, conditions, SLA/escalation, and connector-rule stubs), **Phase 3 — Implementation** (connector schemas, task values, and connector-rule upgrades), **Phase 4 — Validate** (authoritative validate + dump), **Phase 5 — Publish** (optional Studio Web upload), **Phase 6 — Debug** (optional CLI debug run). Hard stops gate Phase 2→3, Phase 4 retry exhaustion, Phase 5 entry, and Phase 6 entry. Read [phased-execution.md](phased-execution.md) for full phase contracts, informational Phase 2 validate, hard-stop prompts, re-entry protocol, retry policy, and abort semantics. Step numbers are stable labels; follow the order stated by each phase.

## Per-plugin execution

Every plugin uses direct JSON writes via its `impl-json.md`. Cross-cutting mechanics (ID generation, Pre-flight Checklist, primitive ops, the canonical write contract) are in [case-editing-operations.md](case-editing-operations.md).

**Per-section batched writes — mandatory.** Process `tasks.md` one **section** at a time (Phase 2: §4.2.1 vars, §4.3 triggers, §4.4 stages, §4.6 task-shapes, §4.8 SLA, §4.7 conditions; Phase 3: §9.7 connector schema, §9.8 I/O binding, §10.5 connector-rule upgrades):

1. **One Read** of `caseplan.json` at section entry.
2. **Writes sized to section** — pick by T-entry count:
   - **<10 T-entries** — N Edits in sequence, one per T-entry. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits.
   - **≥10 T-entries** — single whole-section Edit or Write replacing the section's container (e.g., `schema.nodes`, a stage's `data.tasks`). Compose the complete post-section state in reasoning from the section-entry Read, then emit one write. Untouched siblings (other sections, root fields, unrelated nodes) MUST be copied verbatim — drop nothing.
3. **One validate** at section boundary.

TaskUpdate items keyed by T-number are the audit trail — mark each `in_progress` before composing the entry's mutation, `completed` after the write returns success. The audit trail stays T-by-T even when the file diff collapses to one whole-section write.

**Bundle status text with tool_use.** Any progress text emitted alongside writes MUST share the same assistant turn as the next tool_use (text block + tool_use block in one content array). Standalone text-only turns between Edits are forbidden — they each cost ~5s inference + full cache replay for no work. Cap inline status to ≤1 sentence / ~20 tokens. **Hard token cap:** any single text block >200 tokens (or >500 tokens for allow-listed exceptions — completion reports, AskUserQuestion preambles, validate result summaries) is a planning monologue, forbidden regardless of content. **Forbidden announcement verbs** at any length: text blocks starting with `Building`, `Composing`, `Writing`, `Drafting`, `Generating`, `Now I'll`, `Next:`, `Approach:`, `Strategy:`, `Plan:`, `Caveman push:`, `Big single Write:`, `Let me`, or any other narration of the imminent tool call. The tool_use input IS the announcement.

**Cap single Write at ~15K out tok / ~40KB.** When a section's whole-section Write would exceed this, keep the per-section cadence: root/nodes/vars and task shapes first, then Phase 2 SLA and conditions, then Phase 3 connector/value details. For cases with ≥40 tasks or ≥8 stages, NEVER emit the full populated caseplan.json in one Write. A single 15K-out-tok Write turn pays ~150s inference; smaller turns let validate gates catch field drops between phases. Build-assembler helper scripts (`/tmp/build-caseplan.js` etc.) are forbidden — they violate Rule 13 regardless of `/tmp` placement or framing.

For CLI-gated sections (§4.6 non-connector schema, §9.7 connector schema), use **gather-then-write**: run all CLI calls first, collect results in reasoning, then enter the Read → writes → validate batch.

Full contract — recovery, tool primitive selection (Edit default, whole-section Write at ≥10 T-entries), audit trail, scope — in [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical). Phase 1 `tasks.md` building uses the same section-batched contract per [planning.md §4.0a](planning.md).

> **Per-node-type detail lives in plugins.** This document covers the cross-cutting execution workflow. For how to execute a specific node, consult the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`:

## Issue Log — Initialize Before Step 6

Before any build step, initialize an empty issue list **in the agent's reasoning** (not as a file, not via subprocess). All plugins append to this shared list during execution. Dump to `tasks/build-issues.md` via the Write tool after Step 12. See [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md) for the entry format, severity levels, and file schema.

```text
# pseudocode — kept in the agent's reasoning, not on disk
issues = []  # shared across all steps
```

---

## Seed Phase 2 progress todos — Before Step 6

Before Step 6, seed TodoWrite with the section-level items below. Mark each `in_progress` on entry, `completed` on exit. Replace any Phase 1 todos — do not append.

1. Scaffold solution + project + root case (Step 6)
2. Add triggers (Step 6.1)
3. Declare variables + arguments (Step 6.2)
4. Refresh entry-points.json input/output (Step 6.3)
5. Add stages (Step 7)
6. Write task shapes (Step 9)
7. Regenerate bindings_v2.json (Step 9.4)
8. Write SLA + escalation objects (Step 11)
9. Add conditions with connector-rule stubs (Step 10)
10. Preview validate + boundary (Step 11.9)

(No edge step — Rule 20; see Step 8.)

**Per-T-entry sub-items.** Inside each section, also seed one TodoWrite item per T-entry the section will Edit (e.g., `T04 stage "Intake"`, `T05 stage "Review"`). Mark each `in_progress` before composing the entry's mutation in reasoning, `completed` after the Edit returns success. These per-T-entry items are the audit trail — section-level Edits collapse the file diff, but the todo log preserves T-by-T progress for reviewers (per [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical)).

# Phase 2 — Prototyping (Steps 6 – 11.9)

Execution order: 6 → 6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3 → 7 → 9 → 9.4 → 11 → 10 → 11.9. Step numbers are stable labels; SLA objects run before conditions so `sla-status-change` can reference emitted IDs. The preview contains the complete case flow and SLA model; task values, connector task schemas, and final connector-rule configuration remain deferred. Full contract in [phased-execution.md § Phase 2](phased-execution.md#phase-2--prototyping).

## Step 6 — Create the Case project structure

The case file must live inside a solution + project. The case plugin owns project scaffolding **and** the root caseplan write. Solution setup and project registration are the only CLI calls. **Never use `uip maestro case cases add` (or another case mutation command) to create the root caseplan** — execute the T01 direct-JSON recipe so required root metadata such as `caseDirectlyPassTaskOutputs` is emitted. **Never use `uip maestro case init`** — T01 writes the same 5 files, and run outside `<SolutionDir>` (which includes the `solution init && case init` chain) it auto-creates a second solution and forks the working root — see [`case-commands.md` § uip maestro case init](case-commands.md#uip-maestro-case-init).

1. **Step 6.0 (CLI)** — `uip solution init <SolutionName>` — creates the solution directory + `.uipx`. **Idempotent w.r.t. a Phase 1 Create:** if the Rule 17 **Create** flow already scaffolded the solution in Phase 1 (per [registry-discovery.md § Create-on-Missing → 0 Prerequisite](registry-discovery.md#create-on-missing-build-and-rediscovery)), the `.uipx` already exists — **skip this call iff that exact `<SolutionDir>/<SolutionName>.uipx` is present** (same canonical name + working-root location — [plugins/case/planning.md § Naming](plugins/case/planning.md#project-structure-prerequisites)). Re-running `init` over an existing solution errors, and a differently-named or -located `init` would fork the solution.
2. **T01 (plugin)** — execute [`plugins/case/impl-json.md`](plugins/case/impl-json.md) in full:
   - § Scaffold writes 5 boilerplate files (`project.uiproj`, `operate.json`, `entry-points.json`, `bindings_v2.json`, `package-descriptor.json`) directly into `<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/`.
   - § Write caseplan.json writes the root skeleton (`root` + empty `nodes: []` + empty `edges: []`).
3. **Step 6.0b (CLI)** — `uip solution projects add <AbsolutePathToProjectDir> <AbsolutePathToUipxFile> --output json` — registers the project in `.uipx.Projects[]`. **Both arguments MUST be absolute paths.** Relative form `uip solution projects add <ProjectName> <SolutionName>.uipx` fails with `Failed to add project to solution` regardless of CWD. Runs after `project.uiproj` exists.
4. **Step 6.0c (verify)** — exactly one `.uipx` under the working root, at `<SolutionDir>/<SolutionName>.uipx`. A second manifest is a forked solution: read the stray project first — delete that solution directory if it holds no work, else adopt it as `<SolutionDir>`. Validate cannot catch this; it reads only the caseplan path given.

**No trigger is emitted at T01.** The primary trigger is added by the triggers plugin at T02 — its ID is generated by that plugin. `entry-points.json` is scaffolded with an empty `entryPoints[]` array — the triggers plugin owns every insertion.

## Step 6.1 — Add triggers

For each trigger T-entry in `tasks.md §4.3`, open the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`:

- Manual / Timer / Event (resolved) → `plugins/triggers/<type>/impl-json.md` §3
- Event (UNRESOLVED) → [`plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md` § Placeholder fallback](plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md) — node still written; case stays reachable

Each plugin writes one node to `caseplan.json.nodes[]` and appends one entry to `entry-points.json.entryPoints[]` atomically. Capture every `TriggerId` for Step 6.2 — an In-arg's `elementId` resolves to `id-map[<sourceTriggers T-number>].id`, or the primary trigger (T02) when its `sourceTriggers` is blank.

## Step 6.2 — Declare global variables and arguments

For each variable/argument T-entry from `tasks.md §4.2.1`, write entries directly into `caseplan.json` per [`plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md). This step populates top-level `variables` (inputs, outputs, inputOutputs) and trigger output mappings. Execute these before adding stages — downstream tasks and conditions reference variables via `=vars.<id>`.

## Step 6.3 — Refresh entry-points.json input/output

After Step 6.2, project the declared In/Out arguments onto every `entry-points.json` entry's `input`/`output` schema per [entry-points-sync.md](entry-points-sync.md). Triggers (Step 6.1) scaffold each entry with empty `input`/`output` because variables don't exist yet; this back-fills them. Prerequisites — all entries (Step 6.1) + all In/Out args (Step 6.2) — are complete here, and In/Out formal args never change in Phase 3, so the file is correct from the Phase-2 publish branch onward. Idempotent — re-run on regenerate. Verified by Step 12 Check 6.

## Step 7 — Add stages

For each stage in `tasks.md §4.4`, execute per [`plugins/stages/impl-json.md`](plugins/stages/impl-json.md). **Capture the generated `StageId` for every stage** into the name → ID map (and into `id-map.json`) — downstream tasks, conditions, and SLA all reference it.

`isRequired` from `tasks.md` is planning-only metadata; it is not written into the stage node. It is consumed by case-exit-conditions with `rule-type: required-stages-completed` (Step 10).

## Step 8 — (RETIRED — no edges)

No edge-building step (Rule 20) — stage transitions are entry/exit conditions, written in Phase 2 Step 10. Multi-trigger cases: add extra triggers via the trigger plugin (Step 6.1); any trigger entering the case activates the first stage's `case-entered` condition.

## Step 9 — Add tasks (Phase 2 shape, gather-then-write)

**Phase A — gather.** For each non-connector task in `tasks.md §4.6`, run `uip maestro case tasks describe --type <type> --id <entityKey> --output json` and collect the input schema in reasoning. Connector tasks (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) skip the gather — `case spec` defers to Phase 3 Step 9.7. Unresolved tasks skip too — they become placeholders per Step 9.1. **Inline-built siblings (agent / api-workflow, Rule 17 Create) also skip the gather** — they were resolved + bound in Phase 1 with I/O read from the sibling's on-disk `entry-points.json`; their `taskTypeId` is a local audit-only key with no tenant resource, so tenant `tasks describe` does not apply. See the per-type Built-inline notes: [`plugins/tasks/agent/impl-json.md`](plugins/tasks/agent/impl-json.md), [`plugins/tasks/api-workflow/impl-json.md`](plugins/tasks/api-workflow/impl-json.md).

**Phase B — batched write.** One Read of `caseplan.json`. Then one Edit per task in §4.6 order, appending the task node to its stage's `data.tasks` structure per the matching plugin's `impl-json.md` and the placement contract below. **Capture each `TaskId`** — Phase 2 conditions and Phase 3 cross-task references need it. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits. One validate at section end.

Per-class shape inside each Edit:

| Task class | Phase 2 `data` content |
|---|---|
| Non-connector (`process`, `agent`, `rpa`, `action`, `api-workflow`, `case-management`, `wait-for-timer`) | Full `data.inputs[]` schema from the Phase A gather. Each input's `value` is `""`. Outputs populated per plugin. |
| Connector (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) | `data.typeId` + `data.connectionId` set. `data.inputs` omitted. **Do NOT call `case spec` in Phase 2** — schema discovery happens in Phase 3. |
| Unresolved (any class) | Placeholder task per Step 9.1 — empty `data: {}` plus action-only extras. |

**Do NOT bind input `value` fields in Step 9.** All literals, expressions, and cross-task references written in Phase 3 Step 9.8 per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md).

On context-compaction mid-gather: re-Read `caseplan.json`, scan for §4.6 tasks not yet appended, re-run Phase A for those only.

**Task placement contract.** Placement is determined by `activation-mode` + `entry-rule` from `tasks.md`; `lane` is only the planned task-set index after the mode decision. If the values conflict, task mode wins and the completion report must mention the lane correction.

- `activation-mode: sequential` or `entry-rule: runs-sequentially` → append according to the planned task-set order. Strict chains use new single-task inner arrays in declaration order (`[[A], [B], [C]]`); `parallel-after-predecessor` siblings share the same later inner array (`[[A], [B, C], [D]]`).
- `activation-mode: adhoc`, `event-triggered`, `fan-in`, `conditional-gate`, or any standalone non-parallel task → append as its own single-task inner array.
- Only `activation-mode: parallel` or `parallel-after-predecessor` with an explicit same-lane intent and rationale may share an inner array (`[[A, B], [C]]` or `[[A], [B, C], [D]]`). This is the only case where appending to an existing `data.tasks[laneIndex][]` is valid.

**Parallel-after-predecessor guard.** If two or more independent tasks share the same immediate predecessor task or predecessor task set, write them into the same next inner array and keep `activation-mode: parallel-after-predecessor`; do not convert them into separate event-triggered tasks with duplicate `selected-tasks-completed("<previous>")` entry rules. Duplicate selected-task gates on the immediate predecessor are a planning defect to repair before write.

> **`validate` cannot catch a wrong grouping.** Strict-sequential and parallel-after-predecessor emit the same entry rule (`runs-sequentially`); only the `data.tasks` grouping differs. `uip maestro case validate` returns `Valid` for a strict chain, a shared set, a shared set at index 0, and even mixed entry rules inside one set (as of uip 1.198, 2026-08-02). Grouping is enforced only here — get it right at write time; a clean validate is not evidence it is correct.

**Pass `lane: <n>` on every task** only when required by the artifact contract. Default: increment per task within a stage starting at 0; lane is a `data.tasks` task-set index. A strict sequential chain is represented as consecutive single-task sets (`[[A], [B], [C]]`) plus `runs-sequentially` on each task. Reuse the same lane only for intentionally parallel siblings, including stage-start siblings (`[[A, B], [C]]`) and siblings after a predecessor (`[[A], [B, C], [D]]`). Sequencing comes from the task's `entryConditions` and the order of task sets in `data.tasks`, not from lane-sharing alone.

**Task envelope fields.** Write `isRequired` and `shouldRunOnlyOnce` from `tasks.md`. If `runOnlyOnce` is omitted, default `shouldRunOnlyOnce` to `false` to match frontend new-task behavior. Do not infer `true` from task type; re-entry semantics from the SDD are the source of truth.

### Step 9.1 — Placeholder tasks for unresolved resources

When a task entry's `taskTypeId` (or `typeId` / `connectionId` for connector tasks) is `<UNRESOLVED: …>`, create a **placeholder task** instead of halting. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md) for the canonical reference.

For every task class (process / agent / rpa / action / api-workflow / case-management / connector-activity / connector-trigger): follow the Unresolved Fallback section of the matching `plugins/tasks/<type>/planning.md` and write a task with `type` + `displayName` + `id` + `elementId` + `isRequired`, `data: {}`, and no `taskTypeId` / `connectionId` keys directly to `caseplan.json` per `plugins/tasks/<type>/impl-json.md`.

**Skip all input binding for placeholder tasks** — they have no input schema. Capture the intended wiring from the fenced `wiring notes` code block in `tasks.md` into the completion report so the user knows what to hook up after registering the resource.

Placeholder tasks integrate with the rest of the graph:
- **Task-entry conditions** use the captured placeholder `TaskId` normally.
- **Stage-exit `selected-tasks-completed`** rules reference placeholder `TaskId`s normally.
- **Cross-task variable bindings** are deferred — the user binds them after attaching the real resource.

## Step 9.4 — Regenerate bindings_v2.json (batch)

After all non-connector tasks are written (Step 9), regenerate `bindings_v2.json` once per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Regenerate](bindings-v2-sync.md). This single pass converts all root bindings accumulated during Step 9 — no per-task regeneration needed.

## Step 11 — Write SLA and escalation objects (per-target Edit batch)

One Read of `caseplan.json` at Step 11 entry. Group `tasks.md §4.8` entries by target (root or stage). For each target, compose and write the complete `slaRules[]` array per [`plugins/sla/impl-json.md`](plugins/sla/impl-json.md).

Mint each stable `sla_` / `esc_` ID while composing its object, write the object and its `id-map.json` entry in the same section, and reject collisions before the Edit. An escalation-only target still receives the documented synthetic default SLA object. There is no separate ID-preallocation pass: Step 10 resolves `sla-status-change` references against the objects already present in `caseplan.json`, with `id-map.json` as a cross-check. One validate at section end.

## Step 10 — Add conditions (per (scope, target) Edit batch)

One Read of `caseplan.json` at Step 10 entry. Group `tasks.md §4.7` entries by `(scope, target)` pair: each pair becomes one Edit replacing the relevant conditions array on its target node.

| Scope | Target | Edit replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Stage entry | one stage | `nodes[stage].data.entryConditions` |
| Stage exit | one stage | `nodes[stage].data.exitConditions` |
| Task entry | one task | `data.entryConditions` on the task object |
| Case exit | root | `metadata.caseExitRules` |

Per-scope composition rules live in the matching plugin's `impl-json.md`. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits; run one validate at section end.

For every `wait-for-connector` rule, write the canonical stub `uipath` from [`connector-trigger-impl.md § Placeholder fallback`](connector-trigger-impl.md#placeholder-fallback) in Phase 2 **even when its connector resolved in planning**. Do not call `case spec` and do not add Connection/Folder bindings here. Its T-entry's `id-map.json` value must include `{kind:"condition", id:"<conditionId>", ruleId:"<ruleId>", scope:"<scope>", targetId:"<containerId>"}` so Phase 3 can locate the exact stub without matching display text (`targetId` is the stage ID, task ID, or `root`; task-entry entries also retain `stageId`). Phase 3 Step 10.5 upgrades only `rule.uipath`; a truly unresolved connector keeps the same stub and is reported at completion.

## Step 11.9 — Preview validate + Phase 2 boundary

End of Phase 2. Full contract (summary content, prompt options, publish branch, abort cleanup, continue branch) lives in [phased-execution.md § Phase 2 hard stop](phased-execution.md#phase-2-hard-stop).

1. Try the preview profile:

   ```bash
   uip maestro case validate "<caseplan.json path>" --skeleton-v2 --output json
   ```

2. Fall back once to `--skeleton` only when the parser response names `--skeleton-v2` as unknown or unsupported (typically `ErrorCode: "invalid_argument"` and exit code 3). Exit 3 without that flag-specific message is not sufficient. A v2 validation result containing genuine case errors means the profile ran; capture those findings and do **not** fall back.
3. Print the selected profile plus error/warning counts, then execute the Rule 11 boundary branch. This validation is advisory: never halt solely on its findings. Legacy `--skeleton` checks structure only, so its summary must say rules/SLA remain covered by authoritative Phase 4 validation.

On continue (either `Skip publish and continue` or `Continue to implementation` after publish), proceed to Step 9.6.

---

# Phase 3 — Implementation (Steps 9.6 – 11.5)

Execution order: 9.6 → 9.7 → 9.8 → 10.5 → 11.5 → 12. Phase 3 wires connector task schemas, input/output values, resolved connector-rule configuration, and in-expression markers. Conditions and SLA already exist from Phase 2. Full contract in [phased-execution.md § Phase 3](phased-execution.md#phase-3--implementation).

## Step 9.6 — Phase 3 re-entry

Before any Phase 3 mutation:

1. **Re-read `tasks.md`** — per Rule 7 of `SKILL.md`.
2. **Re-read `caseplan.json`** — rebuild name → ID maps from authoritative artifact. See [phased-execution.md § Re-entry protocol](phased-execution.md#re-entry-protocol) for which fields to index.
3. **Seed Phase 3 progress todos** — call TodoWrite with the section-level items below. Mark each `in_progress` on entry, `completed` on exit. Phase 2 todos (if any) are stale — replace, do not append.
   1. Wire connector task schemas (Step 9.7)
   2. Bind task I/O values (Step 9.8)
   3. Upgrade resolved connector-bound condition rules (Step 10.5)
   4. Resolve in-expression `vars.$xref` markers (Step 11.5)

   Inside each section, also seed per-T-entry sub-items (one per T-entry that section will Edit). Mark each `in_progress` before composing the entry's mutation in reasoning, `completed` after the Edit returns success. Per-T-entry items are the audit trail under the per-section batched contract (per [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical)).

Never trust in-memory maps from Phase 2 without re-reading `caseplan.json` — context may be compacted across hard stop.

## Step 9.7 — Connector task detail (gather-then-write)

**Phase A — gather.** For each connector task (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) in `tasks.md`:

1. Run `get-connection` (each task runs its own — never reuse).
2. Run `uip maestro case spec --type <activity|trigger> --activity-type-id <id> --connection-id <id> --input-details '<json>' --output json` per the plugin's `impl-json.md`.
3. Substitute `{{CONN_BINDING_ID}}` / `{{FOLDER_BINDING_ID}}` placeholders in `caseShape.context[*].value` with minted binding ids; mint `var` / `id` / `elementId` on `caseShape.inputs` / `outputs` per the plugin's uniqueness rule.

Hold all gathered shapes (per-task `caseShape` + root-level Connection + FolderKey bindings) in reasoning. Skip connector tasks that are placeholders (unresolved `typeId` / `connectionId`).

**Phase B — batched write.** One Read of `caseplan.json`. Then for each gathered task: one Edit setting `data.context = caseShape.context`, `data.inputs = caseShape.inputs`, `data.outputs = caseShape.outputs` plus the matching root-level Connection + FolderKey binding entries. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits.

**Phase C — sync + validate.** Populate IS connection cache per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Populate IS connection cache](bindings-v2-sync.md). Regenerate `bindings_v2.json` once per [bindings-v2-sync.md § Regenerate](bindings-v2-sync.md) — single pass includes non-connector bindings from Step 9 and Connection bindings from this step. Run validate.

On context-compaction mid-gather: re-Read `caseplan.json`, scan for connector tasks without `data.context` populated, re-run Phase A for those only.

## Step 9.8 — Bind task input/output values (per-task Edit batch)

One Read of `caseplan.json` at Step 9.8 entry. Then **one Edit per task** replacing that task's full `data.inputs` array. Skip the re-Read between sibling Edits. Skip placeholder tasks entirely — they have no inputs.

Per-task composition (in reasoning, before that task's Edit) per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md):

1. Literals / expressions (`input = "<value>"`): write `<value>` to `input.value`.
2. Cross-task references (`input <- "Stage"."Task".output`): resolve the source output reference ID from the just-Read `caseplan.json` using [`io-binding/impl-json.md` § Output reference ID](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#output-reference-id-authoritative), then write `=vars.<outputReferenceId>` to the target input's `value`.

If a cross-task reference points to a task that does not exist in the just-Read `caseplan.json`, halt — `tasks.md` ordering is wrong; report to the user.

One validate at section end.

## Step 10.5 — Upgrade connector-bound condition-rule stubs (gather-then-write)

Read `caseplan.json` and scan all four condition scopes for `wait-for-connector` rules whose `uipath.context` still contains the canonical `connectorKey: "placeholder"` and `operation: "placeholder"` entries. Match each rule to its `tasks.md` connector fields through its Phase 2 `id-map.json` entry.

For each matched rule whose connector resolved in planning, run the connector-trigger `case spec --type trigger --input-details` procedure, mint its output IDs/element IDs, and gather its root Connection/Folder bindings. Then Edit **only that rule's `uipath` block**. Preserve the enclosing condition array plus the rule's `id`, `rule`, `conditionExpression`, scope, and placement. Apply declared rule-output bindings after the real outputs exist.

If the connector is `<UNRESOLVED>` or `case spec` fails, leave the stub unchanged, log it, and list it in the completion report. After all successful upgrades, populate the IS cache and regenerate `bindings_v2.json` once. Re-scan: every resolved rule must be free of `"placeholder"`; any remaining stub must map to a reported unresolved connector. Full procedure and scope-specific `elementId` rules: [`connector-trigger-impl.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule`](connector-trigger-impl.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule).

## Step 11.5 — Resolve in-expression `vars.$xref` markers (whole-file pass)

Runs after bindings (9.8) and connector-rule upgrades (10.5), when every task / trigger / rule output is minted and deduped. Conditions and SLA were already written in Phase 2. Resolve every `vars.$xref('Stage','Task','output')` marker in `caseplan.json` in ONE pass: one Read, then Edit each string value holding a marker — resolve the source through the common output-reference-ID algorithm and substitute bare `vars.<outputReferenceId>` (no leading `=`; the marker already sits inside `=js:`). Sink-blind: covers composite input payloads, `conditionExpression`, SLA `expression`, computed `=` outputs, and connector body fields in one place. An unresolved name-triple or reference ID is an ERROR (Check 4 below). Algorithm + pseudocode: [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md § In-Expression Marker Resolution`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#in-expression-marker-resolution-step-115). One validate at section end.

## Step 12 — End-of-Phase-3 validator pass

> **Algorithm reference:** the per-check pseudocode + AskUserQuestion prompt templates + skill-response-per-pick details all live in [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md § Binding Procedure`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#binding-procedure). This step is the orchestration hook; that doc is the algorithm. When in doubt, follow the impl-json doc.

After value bindings (Step 9.8), connector-rule upgrades (Step 10.5), and marker resolution (Step 11.5), invoke the end-of-Phase-3 validator — Checks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Phase 2 conditions and SLA remain in place throughout.

- **Check 1** — Resolve every `=vars.X` reference against `variables.{inputs, inputOutputs}[].id`. Scan all task input `value` fields, entry/exit condition expressions (stage and task), case-exit and trigger rule expressions, SLA expressions, and `=js:` expressions anywhere they appear. On unresolved → **AskUserQuestion** offering: (a) name the intended variable, (b) remove the reference, (c) continue with best-effort emit (entry logged under Open Items, runtime returns undefined).
- **Check 2 — Out-arg producer presence** — For every formal Out-arg in `variables.outputs[]`, verify the producer/Default situation per [`io-binding/impl-json.md` § Check 2](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md):
  - **Has Default but no companion** → AskUserQuestion.
  - **No Default + producer declared in SDD on a Rule 17 placeholder task** (declared-but-unresolvable) → no prompt; silent log to `## Open Items for User` in `tasks/build-issues.md`. Rule 17 already prompted the author for this task.
  - **No Default + no producer declared anywhere (pure orphan)** → AskUserQuestion offering 4 options: (a) add producer task output, (b) add Default value, (c) recategorize as Variable / remove, (d) continue with best-effort emit (entry logged under Open Items).
- **Check 3** — Type mismatch between `=vars.X` reference and consumer slot → log WARN inline (non-blocking; string coercion is runtime-tolerant).
  - **Check 4 — No surviving `$xref` markers** — Scan every string value in `caseplan.json` for the literal `$xref(`. Step 11.5 resolves all; any survivor means its name-triple or output reference ID failed — the same class of failure as a Check 1 unresolved `=vars.X`, so it gets the same interactive remediation. On unresolved → **AskUserQuestion** (present the outputs that DO exist on the named task as candidates): (a) name the intended source output — skill rewrites the triple, re-resolves, substitutes `vars.<outputReferenceId>`; (b) edit the SDD expression + re-run the Phase 1 dispatcher (when the output genuinely doesn't exist); (c) continue with best-effort emit (token left unsubstituted, entry logged under Open Items; `vars.$xref(...)` throws at runtime until fixed). Detail: [`io-binding/impl-json.md` § Check 4](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md).
  - **Check 5 — Resolved-resource I/O completeness** — For each task with a persisted contract in `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, verify every **required** declared input has a bound `value` and every extract output `Field` exists in the resolved output contract. An upstream-output-fed input (`=vars.<outputReferenceId>` / resolved `$xref`) counts as bound with NO §1.5 row. On unbound-required-input or phantom-output-field → **AskUserQuestion**: (a) bind / re-point, (b) `<UNRESOLVED>`+review-item / drop row, (c) continue with best-effort emit (entry logged under Open Items; runtime null until fixed). Tasks with no contract (placeholder / `<UNRESOLVED>`) are skipped. Detail: [`io-binding/impl-json.md` § Check 5](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#check-5--resolved-resource-io-completeness).
- **Check 6 — Entry-point schema parity** — Verify every `entry-points.json` entry's `input`/`output` matches the In/Out args projected at Step 6.3 (keys, type mapping, `required`, `file`/`jsonSchema` shapes), plus unique `filePath` fragments and no orphaned `inputs[].elementId`. **Non-interactive:** on mismatch re-run the Step 6.3 refresh once; if still divergent (or a uniqueness/orphan finding) log to `## Open Items for User` and continue. No AskUserQuestion. Algorithm: [`entry-points-sync.md § Check 6`](entry-points-sync.md#check-6--entry-point-schema-parity-step-12-validator).
- **Check 7 — Bindings sidecar parity** — Compare `bindings_v2.json.resources[]` with the complete projection of top-level `caseplan.json.bindings[]` using [`bindings-v2-sync.md`](bindings-v2-sync.md). If they differ — including non-empty bindings with empty resources — regenerate the full sidecar once and re-check. If they still differ, halt before Phase 4. This check is non-interactive.
- **Check 8 — Global generated-output ID uniqueness** — Read the completed `caseplan.json` and build one owner-keyed uniqueness pool from root variables plus every task, trigger, and connector-rule output across all condition scopes. Include unused and schema-generated outputs such as `Error` and `response`. Apply the [global uniqueness rule](plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md#uniqueness-rule): on collision, suffix the later producer, update only that producer's fields and consumers by producer ownership, then re-run the affected binding and marker-resolution steps. Re-read and re-scan the complete pool; halt before Phase 4 if any duplicate generated `id` or `var` remains. `uip maestro case validate` success does not satisfy this check.
- **Check 9 — Resolved-resource emission and repair preservation** — Read `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, `tasks.md`, `caseplan.json`, and `bindings_v2.json`. For every registry entry with a non-null `selected`, locate its declared `(stage, task)` in `caseplan.json`. The task MUST exist and MUST NOT have `data: {}`. For non-connector task types, `data.name` and `data.folderPath` MUST each be `=bindings.<id>` references to complete root binding entries (all required fields present) — Check 7 covers their projection into `bindings_v2.json.resources[]`. A selected resource is never eligible for a placeholder fallback. Any whole-file Write used to repair a finding follows the repair-preservation contract in [`case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract`](case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical) — a dropped stage, task, root binding, or selected-resource task is a hard failure. Repair only the named task/binding with a targeted Edit, then repeat Checks 7 and 9. Do not enter Phase 4, report completion, or downgrade this finding to an Open Item while it remains unresolved; `uip maestro case validate` success does not satisfy this check.
- **Check 10 — Formal-arg slot ID format** — For every entry in `variables.inputs[]` and `variables.outputs[]`, verify `id` matches `^v[A-Za-z0-9]{8}$` per [`global-vars/impl-json.md` § Formal-arg slot ID format](plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md#formal-arg-slot-id-format). The most common violation is copying the human-readable companion name into the formal slot (e.g. `variables.inputs[].id: "applicantName"` instead of `"vK3mNp9Qx"`) — `uip maestro case validate` does not catch this, so it silently produces a case whose BPMN packaging can reject the id. **Non-interactive repair:** mint a replacement `v`+8-chars id, deduplicated against the Check 8 global pool; update the `variables.inputs[]`/`variables.outputs[]` entry's `id` to the new value; for an `inputs[]` (In-arg) entry, also find its bound trigger node's `data.inputs.outputs[]` bridge entry whose `source == "=vars.<old id>"` and rewrite it to `"=vars.<new id>"` (skip this sub-step when the bound trigger is a placeholder — no bridge was ever written, per [global-vars/impl-json.md § In argument](plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md#in-argument)). Leave `name`, `var`, and the `inputOutputs[]` companion's `id` unchanged — only the formal slot's `id` (and, for In-args, the bridge's `source`) are rewritten. Re-scan `variables.inputs[]`/`variables.outputs[]` after repair; halt before Phase 4 if any entry still fails the format after one repair pass.
- **Check 11 — resourceKey self-consistency (non-connector tasks)** — For every top-level `bindings[]` pair sharing a `resourceKey` on a non-connector task (`process`, `agent`, `rpa`, `api-workflow`, `case-management`, `action`), verify `resourceKey` is internally consistent with the pair's own `default` fields per [`bindings/impl-json.md` § resourceKey construction](plugins/variables/bindings/impl-json.md#resourcekey-construction--non-connector-tasks): normally `resourceKey == "<folderPath-binding default>.<name-binding default>"`; for an inline-built sibling (agent/api-workflow whose `folderPath` binding `default` is `""`), `resourceKey == "solution_folder.<name-binding default>"` instead. The most common violation is copying a tenant identity value — the SDD's "Resource Identity" column, a `tasks describe --id` argument, or a registry `entityKey` — directly into `resourceKey` instead of constructing the composite string. `uip maestro case validate` does not catch this: it silently produces an unresolvable process reference that only faults at `case debug`. **Non-interactive repair:** recompute the correct `resourceKey` from the pair's own `default` fields and rewrite both bindings in the shared pair (a pair's two `resourceKey` values must stay identical), then re-run Check 7 to resync `bindings_v2.json`. Re-scan `bindings[]` after repair; halt before Phase 4 if any pair still fails after one repair pass.
- **Check 12 — Connector node resolution completeness** — Checks 9 and 11 exempt connector nodes; this check covers them. Read `tasks/registry-resolved.json` and `caseplan.json`. Enumerate every **connector node**: tasks typed `wait-for-connector` / `execute-connector-activity`, the case-level `Intsvc.EventTrigger` node, and every `wait-for-connector` rule across all 4 condition scopes (stage-entry / stage-exit / task-entry, plus case-exit under `metadata.caseExitRules`). For each whose registry entry has a **non-null `selected`** — i.e. the connector resolved in planning — verify its connector block (`data` for a task, `data.inputs` for a trigger node, `uipath` for a rule):
  1. `context` is present and non-empty. A block carrying only `serviceType` + `typeId` + `connectionId` is the Phase 2 / `case spec`-failed shape ([connector-trigger/impl-json.md § Graceful degradation](plugins/tasks/connector-trigger/impl-json.md#graceful-degradation)) and is a **failure** here — the spec call succeeded, so the populated `caseShape` must be spliced in.
  2. `context[name="connectorKey"].value` equals `selected.connectorKey`, and a `context[name="connection"]` entry exists whose `value` is `=bindings.<id>`.
  3. No `"placeholder"` values anywhere in `context` (legal only for a genuinely unresolved connector, which by definition has `selected: null`), and no residual `{{CONN_BINDING_ID}}` / `{{FOLDER_BINDING_ID}}` / `{{TRIGGER_REGISTRATION_KEY}}` token anywhere in the node.
  4. Every `=bindings.<id>` referenced by the block resolves to a complete entry in top-level `caseplan.json.bindings[]` (ConnectionId + FolderKey, the latter omitted only when `spec.connection.folderKey` was null).
  5. The node's spec-cache artifact exists — `tasks/spec-cache.<elementId>.json` for tasks and rules, or this trigger's T-number entry in `tasks/trigger-spec-cache.json` for the case-level event trigger — and its cached `Context` matches the written `context` modulo the placeholder substitutions in (3) and the key re-casing in [connector-trigger-impl.md § Normalize key casing](connector-trigger-impl.md#normalize-key-casing-pascalcase--camelcase). A mismatch means the context was composed from agent memory rather than spliced — forbidden per [connector-trigger-impl.md § Step 4](connector-trigger-impl.md#step-4--substitute-placeholders-in-caseshapecontext).

  **Non-interactive repair:** re-run `case spec --type trigger` (or `--type activity`) for the failing node, persist the response to its spec-cache file, splice `context` / `inputs` / `outputs` verbatim per [connector-trigger-impl.md § Step 4](connector-trigger-impl.md#step-4--substitute-placeholders-in-caseshapecontext) and [§ Step 5](connector-trigger-impl.md#step-5--mint-var--id--elementid-on-inputs-and-outputs), append the missing root bindings per [§ Root-level bindings](connector-trigger-impl.md#root-level-bindings), then re-run Check 7 to resync `bindings_v2.json`. Re-scan after repair; halt before Phase 4 if any resolved connector node still fails after one repair pass. If `case spec` itself fails on the retry, keep the degraded shape, log it under `## Open Items for User` as **"connector node <name> is not runnable — `context` unresolved"**, and report it — do not silently emit it as complete. `uip maestro case validate` success does not satisfy this check: it reports `Valid` for a connector task with an empty `context` and no root bindings.

**Build-with-best policy:** for any user pick of "continue with best-effort emit" on a Check 1, Check 2, Check 4, or Check 5 AskUserQuestion, append a `## Open Items for User` entry to `tasks/build-issues.md` and proceed to Phase 4. AskUserQuestion is the surface; build-with-best is the escape. The skill conservatively emits what it has; Phase 4 validate stays green (structural validity is intact); runtime concerns are listed for pre-publish review.

**Reporting:** at end of Phase 4, count entries in the `## Open Items for User` section of `tasks/build-issues.md` (read the file after writing). If count > 0, the completion report MUST include a literal line of the form:

```
Open Items: <N> entry/entries — review tasks/build-issues.md § Open Items for User before publishing.
```

(Use `entry` for N == 1, `entries` otherwise.) Place this line above the per-stage / per-task summary in the completion report so it's not buried.

End of Phase 3 mutations. Proceed directly to Phase 4 — no hard stop between Phase 3 and Phase 4.

---

# Phase 4 — Validate (Steps 12 – 12.1)

Authoritative validation. Full contract — command, retry policy, AskUserQuestion options — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 4](phased-execution.md#phase-4--validate). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 12 — Full validate

Run validate per [phased-execution.md § Phase 4](phased-execution.md#phase-4--validate). On success: proceed to Step 12.1. On 3rd failure: hard-stop prompt per the same section.

## Step 12.1 — Dump issue log

Write issue list to `tasks/build-issues.md` per [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md). On Phase 4 success → proceed to Phase 5.

---

# Phase 5 — Publish (Steps 13, 14)

Optional Studio Web upload. Full contract — report fields, prompt options, publish commands, pack/publish warning — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 5](phased-execution.md#phase-5--publish). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 13 — Completion report + Publish prompt

Print report fields and run AskUserQuestion per [phased-execution.md § Phase 5](phased-execution.md#phase-5--publish). On `Publish to Studio Web` → Step 14. On `Skip to Debug` → Phase 6.

## Step 14 — Publish to Studio Web

Run `uip solution resources refresh` then `uip solution upload <SolutionDir> --output json --output-filter "{Status: Status, SolutionId: SolutionId, DesignerUrl: DesignerUrl}"` per [phased-execution.md § Publish notes](phased-execution.md#publish-notes) — the filter is mandatory or `DesignerUrl` is lost to response truncation. Print `DesignerUrl`, then proceed to Phase 6.

---

# Phase 6 — Debug (Steps 15, 15a)

Optional CLI debug run. Full contract — prompt options, debug command, safety warning, loop behavior — in [phased-execution.md § Phase 6](phased-execution.md#phase-6--debug). This section is a bridge — do NOT duplicate contract here.

## Step 15 — Debug prompt + session

Run AskUserQuestion + debug command per [phased-execution.md § Phase 6](phased-execution.md#phase-6--debug). On `Run debug session` → run `uip solution resources refresh` then `uip maestro case debug`, loop until `Done`. On `Done` → exit skill. Never auto-run (Rule 12).

## Step 15a — Troubleshoot failed case

When a debug or process run fails, read **[troubleshooting-guide.md](troubleshooting-guide.md)**. Diagnostic priority: incidents → runtime variables → caseplan.json correlation → traces (last resort).

**Diagnose → fix → re-run loop.** After each diagnostic pass, classify root cause and act:

1. **Fixable in `caseplan.json`** (wrong binding, missing condition, malformed expression, incorrect input value): apply targeted fix via matching plugin's `impl-json.md`, re-run `uip maestro case validate`, then re-run Step 15 debug. If the case was already published in Phase 5, re-run Step 14 afterwards so Studio Web holds the fixed build.
2. **Fixable outside `caseplan.json`** (missing/expired connection, unregistered task type, missing Orchestrator asset, permissions): halt agent edits. Report exact resource + remediation steps to user via **AskUserQuestion** with options — `Resource fixed, re-run debug`, `Abort`.
3. **Inconclusive** (no actionable cause): proceed to next round per retry policy.

> **Known by-design debug fault:** an inline-built api-workflow sibling's task failing with incident `170007` ("job's associated process could not be found") under `case debug` is expected — debug does not provision Api siblings (agent siblings do resolve). Do not spend troubleshoot rounds on it; runtime verification needs a full solution deploy, offered via AskUserQuestion per [phased-execution.md § Debug notes](phased-execution.md#debug-notes) (the contract owner).

**Retry policy.** Up to 3 troubleshoot → fix → debug rounds per failed run. Each round must add new context (different element ID, broader scope, fallback command) or apply different fix — do not repeat identical commands or re-apply same fix. Track round count.

**Per-round timeout.** If debug run exceeds 10 minutes wall-clock, treat round as inconclusive and advance to next round (counts toward 3-round limit). Advisory — do not hard-kill subprocess; classify by elapsed time and move on.

After 3rd inconclusive round (or 3rd debug failure post-fix), halt and ask user with **AskUserQuestion**. Report: instance ID, folder key, incident IDs/messages, faulting element ID, variable snapshot, what was tried each round. Options — `Provide additional context` (user supplies hints; run one more targeted round), `Pause for manual investigation`, `Abort`. Do not propose `caseplan.json` edits without confirmed cause.
