## Reference IDs Are Connection-Scoped (CRITICAL)

Every reference ID resolves only within the account authenticated by the connection used to resolve it. A `MailFolder` ID from one Outlook mailbox is invalid in another. A Slack channel ID from one workspace is invalid in another. A Jira project ID from one Atlassian site is invalid in another.

**Never carry a reference ID from one flow, one connection, or one session into another.** Always re-run `uip is resources run list` against the `--connection-id` bound to the current flow — even if you believe you already know the ID from a prior task or earlier in the same session.

A reused reference ID:
- Passes `uip is resources describe` / `node configure` / `flow validate` cleanly (no API call checks the value against the connection).
- Faults at runtime when the connector tries to use the ID against a mailbox/workspace/site that does not contain it.
- Surfaces as a silent fault or generic "no matching resource" error — hard to diagnose without tracing back to the authoring step.

**Rule:** resolve every reference ID fresh, against the current connection, every time. Treat any ID from your context or memory as unverified until re-listed.

## Reference Fields (CRITICAL)

Entries in the describe `requestFields` AND `parameters` (query/path parameters) can have a `reference` section — their value must be looked up from another resource before executing. Scan both arrays: on some connectors the activity's primary input is a path parameter with a reference, and scanning only `requestFields` misses it.

### Reference structure

```json
{
  "name": "channel",
  "type": "string",
  "displayName": "Channel name/ID",
  "required": true,
  "reference": {
    "objectName": "curated_channels?types=public_channel,private_channel",
    "lookupNames": ["name", "id"],
    "lookupValue": "id",
    "path": "/curated_channels?fields=id,name"
  }
}
```

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`reference.objectName`** | The resource to list (use as `<object>` in `run list`). May include query params. |
| **`reference.lookupNames`** | Fields to match the user's input against (e.g., match "general" against `name`) |
| **`reference.lookupValue`** | The field to extract as the resolved value (e.g., `id`) |
| **`reference.path`** | The API path — use `reference.objectName` for the list call |
| **`reference.filterPattern`** | Search endpoint pattern — substitute the user's input into `{filter}` and pass as `--query`. See [Search References](#search-references-filterpattern). |
| **`reference.childPath`** | Scoped child path — used for drill-down references (e.g., folder subfolders) |

> **`objectName` fallback.** If `run list <reference.objectName>` returns 404, the connector uses a symbolic objectName the runner can't resolve (e.g. Data Service `system` → "Entity system does not exist"). Retry with the resource segment of `reference.path`: `/standard-objects` → `run list "<connector-key>" "standard-objects"`.

### Resolution workflow

```bash
# 1. Describe → find entries with "reference" in requestFields AND parameters
uip is resources describe "<connector-key>" "<resource>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --operation Create --output json

# 2. For each reference field, list the referenced object
#    Use reference.objectName as the object name (including any query params)
uip is resources run list "<connector-key>" "<reference.objectName>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --output json

# 3. Match the user's input against reference.lookupNames in the results
#    Extract reference.lookupValue as the resolved ID

# 4. Execute with resolved IDs (not display names)
uip is resources run create "<connector-key>" "<resource>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --body '{"channel": "<resolved-id>"}' --output json
```

### Example: Resolving a Slack channel (list reference)

User says: "Send a message to #general"

1. **Describe** returns `channel` field with `reference.objectName: "curated_channels?types=public_channel,private_channel"`
2. **List** the referenced object:
   ```bash
   uip is resources run list "uipath-salesforce-slack" \
     "curated_channels?types=public_channel,private_channel" \
     --connection-id "<id>" --output json
   ```
3. **Match** "general" against `lookupNames` (`name` field) in results → find `{ "name": "general", "id": "C02CAP3LAAG" }`
4. **Use** the `lookupValue` (`id`) → `"C02CAP3LAAG"` in the `--body`

**Present options to the user** when multiple matches exist. Always use the resolved `lookupValue` (not display names) in `--body` or `--query`.

**Zero matches:** if the completed lookup (`Data.Pagination.HasMore` is `"false"`) finds no entry matching the user's value, do not execute with it — ask the user, presenting the closest candidates as options. Proceed with the unverified value only if the user confirms it.

---

## Scope Filtering (CRITICAL)

`uip is resources run list <connector> <reference-object>` may return BOTH global entries (`scope: null`) and project-scoped entries (`scope.type: "PROJECT"`) — often with the **same display name**. Picking the first match by `.name` silently picks the wrong scope.

**Concrete failure:** Jira issuetype "Task" exists globally as `id=3` and per-project as `id=10659` scoped to project `10851`. Selecting `id=10659` for a different project fails at runtime.

### Rule

When picking a reference value for a curated cascade root field (e.g. `fields.issuetype.id` on Jira), ALWAYS inspect `.scope`:

- `scope: null` → globally applicable, safe.
- `scope.type: "PROJECT"` → valid only when the cascade parent (e.g. `fields.project.key`/`id`) matches `scope.project.id`.

### jq filter

```bash
uip is resources run list "<connector>" "<reference-object>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --output json \
| jq '.Data | map(select(.scope == null or .scope.project.id == "<target-project-id>"))'
```

Apply the same filter to any reference whose entries carry `scope` — not just Jira.

---

## Search References (filterPattern)

Some reference fields point to **search endpoints** that require user input as a query parameter. These have a `filterPattern` property with a `{filter}` placeholder.

### Search reference structure

```json
{
  "name": "productId",
  "displayName": "Product ID",
  "description": "ID of the product to which the ticket is mapped",
  "required": false,
  "reference": {
    "objectName": "search_products",
    "lookupNames": ["productCode", "id"],
    "lookupValue": "id",
    "path": "/search_products",
    "filterPattern": "productCode={filter}"
  }
}
```

### How to detect

If `reference.filterPattern` exists, the reference supports server-side filtering. Omitting the filter does NOT reliably error — some connectors (Microsoft Graph-backed: Teams, Outlook) return the **entire unfiltered collection** instead (thousands of rows, 50/page). Arbitrary query params (`searchTerm=`, `where=`, `filter=`) are silently ignored — only the exact `filterPattern` key filters. Always apply it; never brute-force paginate a large directory when a `filterPattern` exists.

`filterPattern` is surfaced only by `uip is resources describe` (IS-level metadata). Representations that strip it (e.g. Maestro flow `registry get` reference object, which keeps only `objectName`/`lookupValue`/`lookupNames`/`path`/`childPath`) are not authoritative — re-describe at IS level before concluding a reference cannot be filtered.

### Resolution workflow (search)

1. **Get the user's search input** — the value they want to look up (e.g., product name, code)
2. **Substitute into filterPattern** — replace `{filter}` with the user's input
3. **Pass as `--query`** when listing the referenced object:

```bash
# filterPattern: "productCode={filter}"
# User input: "Widget Pro"
uip is resources run list "<connector-key>" "search_products" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --query "productCode=Widget Pro" --output json
```

4. **Match results** against `lookupNames` and extract `lookupValue` as usual

### Example: Resolving a Zoho Desk product

User says: "Create a ticket for product Widget Pro"

1. **Describe** returns `productId` with `reference.filterPattern: "productCode={filter}"`
2. **Search** with user input:
   ```bash
   uip is resources run list "uipath-zoho-desk" "search_products" \
     --connection-id "<id>" --query "productCode=Widget Pro" --output json
   ```
   → `{ "productCode": "WP-100", "id": "1892000000056007" }`
3. **Use** the `lookupValue` (`id`) → `"1892000000056007"` in `--body`

### Example: Resolving a Microsoft Teams user (OData `$filter`)

`filterPattern` may be a full OData `$filter` expression, not just `key={filter}`. Same mechanic: substitute `{filter}`, pass the whole string as `--query`.

1. **Describe** the activity's object (e.g. `bot_direct_messages`) → `userId` reference has `filterPattern: "$filter=startswith(userPrincipalName,'{filter}')"`
2. **Substitute and pass as `--query`.** Single-quote the value so the shell does not expand the literal `$`:
   ```bash
   uip is resources run list "uipath-microsoft-teams" "users" \
     --connection-id "<id>" \
     --query '$filter=startswith(userPrincipalName,'"'"'jane.doe'"'"')' --output json
   ```
   → one row: `{ "id": "7a621d6b-…", "userPrincipalName": "jane.doe@example.com" }`
3. **Use** `lookupValue` (`id`) as the resolved value.

Without the `$filter` this `/users` listing returns the full tenant directory (50/page, thousands of rows). A dedicated by-key endpoint (e.g. Teams `user-by-email/{email}`) is a fallback only when no `filterPattern` exists.

> **If the user doesn't provide a search term**, ask them. Search references cannot be resolved without user input — do NOT call the search endpoint with an empty filter.

## Field Dependency Chains

Some reference fields **depend on other fields** — the child field's valid values are scoped by the parent field's selection. Dependencies are expressed in `reference.path` templates containing `{otherField}` variables that must be substituted.

### How to detect dependencies

Check if `reference.path` contains `{fieldName}` template variables. If so, that field depends on the referenced field. Resolve the parent first.

**CRITICAL: If a parent field value is NOT in the user's prompt, you MUST ask the user for it BEFORE attempting to resolve any child fields.** Do not resolve child fields without a scoped parent — the results will be wrong or ambiguous.

### Dependency chain example

A resource has two reference fields with a dependency chain:

```
Field A → no template variables in path    → resolve first (list resource, pick value)
Field B → path contains {Field A}          → resolve after A (list scoped by A's value)
```

**Wrong** — listing Field B's resource globally returns duplicates from all scopes.

**Correct** — resolve Field A first, then list Field B's resource scoped to Field A's resolved value:

```bash
# Step 1: Resolve Field A (no dependencies)
uip is resources run list "<connector-key>" "<resource-a>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --output json
# → pick value

# Step 2: Resolve Field B scoped to Field A's value
uip is resources run list "<connector-key>" "<resource-a>/<resolved-value>/sub-resource" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --output json
# → only values valid for this scope
```

### General rule

When resolving reference fields:
1. **Sort fields by dependency** — fields with no `{template}` in their reference path come first
2. **Resolve parent fields** — list the parent resource, pick the value
3. **Substitute into child path** — replace `{parentField}` in the child's reference path with the resolved value
4. **Resolve child fields** — list the scoped resource using the substituted path

This pattern applies across all connectors wherever child fields are scoped by parent selections.

## Inferring References Without Describe

When describe metadata is unavailable (see [resources.md — Describe Failures](resources.md#describe-failures)), infer reference fields from naming conventions:

- Fields ending in **`Id`** (e.g., `PromotionId`, `AccountId`) typically reference the object with the matching base name (`Promotion`, `Account`).
- List the inferred object to resolve the ID: `is resources run list "<connector-key>" "<base-name>" --connection-id "<id>" --output json`
- Match the user's value by `Name` or `DisplayName` in the results.

---

## Static Reference-Value Labeling

When baking a **static value** for a field that has a `.reference` block (any connector — Jira `fields.project.key`/`fields.issuetype.id`, Slack `send_as`/`channel`, Outlook `outputTimezone`/`calendarID`, etc.), the AgentHub edit-UI cannot resolve the display label on its own and renders the raw scalar. Persist labels alongside the bound values via `designTimeMetadata.designTimeLookups`.

### Persisted shape

```jsonc
"designTimeMetadata": {
  "designTimeLookups": {
    "<dotted-field-name>": "<displayName> - <value>"
    // e.g. "fields.project.key": "Orchestrator - OR"
    // e.g. "fields.issuetype.id": "Task - 3"
    // e.g. "send_as": "Bot - bot"
    // e.g. "channel": "general - C02CAP3LAAG"
  }
}
```

- Shape is `Record<string, string>`. NOT the array-of-`{id,title}` form that the FE library's TypeScript types may suggest — that is the internal Redux shape, different from persistence.
- Key = the same dotted field name used in `staticValues.<bucket>.<field>`.
- Value = `"<displayName> - <baked-value>"` (literal ` - ` separator).

### Resolving `displayName`

```bash
uip is resources run list "<connector>" "<reference.objectName>" \
  --connection-id "<id>" --output json
```

Match the baked value against `lookupValue` (from the field's `reference` block). Take `lookupNames[0]` from the matching entry as `displayName`.

### Cascade-scoped references

When `reference.path` contains `{parent.field}` placeholders (e.g. Jira `fields.issuetype.id` → `/project/{fields.project.key}/issuetypes`), the reference is logically scoped to a parent value but the CLI's `run list` does not accept a parent-context flag. `reference.objectName` in this case names the path's root (`project`), not the leaf collection you actually want.

Two-step resolution:

1. **Pick the leaf object.** Take the last path segment singular form. For `/project/{fields.project.key}/issuetypes` use `issuetype` (drop trailing `s` if present).
2. **List the leaf object and filter by scope.** Many connectors return both global (`scope: null`) and parent-scoped rows in the same listing:
   ```bash
   uip is resources run list "<connector>" "<leaf-object>" \
     --connection-id "<id>" --output json
   ```
   - If your baked value resolves to a global entry, pick the row with `scope: null`.
   - If it resolves to a parent-scoped entry, pick the row whose `scope.<parentType>.<id>` matches the baked parent value (resolved through its own reference first).
   - Match by `reference.lookupValue` as in the flat case. Take `reference.lookupNames[0]` as the label.

Concrete Jira example — baked `fields.project.key="OR"`, `fields.issuetype.id="3"`:
- Project: `run list … project` → match `key=OR` → `name="Orchestrator"` → `"Orchestrator - OR"`.
- Issuetype: `run list … issuetype` returns ~400+ rows. `id=3` matches `name="Task"` → `"Task - 3"`.

**Jira issuetype scope caveat.** The CLI surfaces every issuetype row with `scope: null` even when Jira itself project-scopes the type (the connector flattens scope). Filtering by `scope` is therefore unreliable for Jira issuetype disambiguation. When multiple rows share a display name (e.g., several `Epic` entries at different ids), verify the candidate id by re-running the cascade describe with `(project.key, issuetype.id)` — a successful describe means the id is valid for that project. Other connectors that return scope honestly still match by `scope.<parentType>.<id>` as described above.

Do NOT re-issue `uip is resources describe -f <parent>=<value>` solely for label resolution — the cascade is intended for required-field expansion. For Jira `curated_create_issue` specifically, omit `--action`; passing it triggers `No api-type ObjectAction matched for fields [...]`.

### Applies to

Every connector with reference-typed fields. Emit one `designTimeLookups` entry per static reference value baked into `staticValues` — Jira, Slack, Outlook, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, and so on.

## Validate Required Fields Before Executing

After resolving references, **check every required field** from the describe response against what the user provided. This is a hard gate — do NOT execute until all required fields have values.

**Process:**
1. Collect all fields where `required: true` from the describe output
2. For each required field, check if the user's prompt contains a value for it
3. If any required field is missing, **ask the user** before proceeding:
   - List the missing fields with their `displayName` and `description`
   - For reference fields, explain what kind of value is expected
   - Wait for the user's response before continuing
4. Only after all required fields are accounted for, proceed to execute

> **Do NOT guess or skip missing required fields.** A missing required field will cause a runtime error. It is always better to ask than to assume.
