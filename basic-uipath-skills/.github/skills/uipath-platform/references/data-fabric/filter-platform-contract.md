# Filter Platform Contract

Which operators each field type accepts, so you can build a valid `records query` filter. For body usage and unsupported-operator handling, see [`records-query.md`](records-query.md) and data-fabric.md Rule 17.

## Filter body

A filter group has three fields:

- `logicalOperator` — `AND`/`OR` or `0`/`1`; case-insensitive.
- `queryFilters` — array of leaf clauses, each `{ fieldName, operator, value }` (or `valueList` for `in` / `not in`).
- `filterGroups` — optional array of nested groups. **Each nested group has the same structure as the parent**, so AND/OR may mix per level.

Example:

```json
{
  "logicalOperator": "AND",
  "queryFilters": [
    { "fieldName": "Status", "operator": "=",  "value": "Active" },
    { "fieldName": "Status", "operator": "in", "valueList": ["A", "B"] }
  ],
  "filterGroups": [
    {
      "logicalOperator": "OR",
      "queryFilters": [
        { "fieldName": "Priority", "operator": "=", "value": "high" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `value` is a JSON **string** (`"18"`, `"true"`, ISO-8601 dates), except `null` for empty checks.
- `in` / `not in` use `valueList`; everything else uses `value`.
- `null` value = is-empty (`=`) / is-not-empty (`!=`).
- Response data: `Data: { Items, TotalCount, HasNextPage, NextCursor: { Value }, CurrentPage, TotalPages, SupportsPageJump }`. Records live in `Data.Items`. Page with `--limit` / `--cursor` flags (pass `NextCursor.Value`), never body keys.

## Operator support by field type

Build only within this matrix (✅ supported). The API *runs* some ❌ cells anyway (e.g. `<` on Text — lexicographic, so `"user2@…" < "user20@…"`) and 400s only on unknown operators (`==`, `Equals`, `like`). Never rely on that: when a request needs an unsupported operator/type combo, or has no value, ask the user — don't silently run it (data-fabric.md Rule 17).

| Operator | Text / Multiline | Number / Autonum | Date/Time | Boolean | Choice Set | Relationship | File | Unique ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `=` `!=` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `contains` `not contains` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `startswith` `endswith` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `>` `<` `>=` `<=` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| is empty / not empty | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `in` `not in` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

Complex-field values: **Choice Set** — the integer `NumberId` (multi: `=` takes a sorted JSON-array string `"[1,3]"`, `contains` takes a bare id `"3"`). **Relationship** — the target record's UUID `Id`.

**`MULTILINE_MAX` is outside the matrix entirely** — the Text / Multiline column does NOT cover it. No operator is supported (including is-empty), and no `sortOptions`: server rejects with 400 — *"Field '<name>' is of type MULTILINE_MAX and cannot be used in filters."* / *"Sort field '<name>' is of type MULTILINE_MAX and cannot be used for sorting."* Don't offer the field in filter/sort; if the user asks, surface the limitation and (only with their approval) fetch full values via `records get` and evaluate client-side.

## Unsupported operator, or missing value

If a request needs an out-of-matrix operator/type combo (or an operator outside the list above — `BETWEEN`, regex, `like`), or an operator other than is-empty/not-empty has no value, **don't silently run it**. Ask the user to either **(a)** run the query without that filter, or **(b)** supply a supported one — then apply only their choice, never a default. Compositions often help: `BETWEEN x AND y` → `>=` + `<=` in one `queryFilters` (`logicalOperator: 0`); regex → `contains` / `startswith` / `endswith`.
