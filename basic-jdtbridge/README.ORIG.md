## JDT Bridge

Grep finds strings. JDT Bridge understands Java.

Eclipse's JDT compiler builds a deep semantic index of your code — type hierarchies, cross-project references, method overloads, transitive dependencies. JDT Bridge exposes all of that via the `jdt` CLI, giving AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) the same understanding of your codebase that a human gets in the IDE.

## Why it matters

```bash
# "Who calls this method?" — grep returns 200 hits including comments,
# identically-named methods in other classes, and string literals.
# JDT returns only the 8 actual call sites, with file and line numbers.
jdt refs com.example.dao.OrderRepository save --arity 1

# Read Spring/Hibernate/JDK source code by name.
# Without JDT this is impossible — library sources live inside JARs.
# The agent gets the same "go to definition" power a developer has in the IDE.
jdt src org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionTemplate execute

# "Did my edit compile?" — Maven takes 30-90 seconds for a module build.
# Eclipse's incremental compiler already knows the answer. Sub-second response.
jdt err --project my-app-server

# "What classes implement this interface method?" — grep for a common name
# like "save" or "onInit" returns every class that has that method name.
# JDT resolves the type hierarchy and returns only actual implementations.
jdt impl com.example.core.Repository save --arity 1

# Understand a 600-line class without reading it. Fields, method signatures,
# supertypes, line numbers — structured overview, not raw source.
jdt ti com.example.web.OrderController

# Run a single test method in seconds via Eclipse's built-in runner.
# Maven Surefire takes 30+ seconds of lifecycle overhead for the same thing.
jdt test com.example.service.OrderServiceTest testCalculateTotal
```

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js >= 20, Java, Maven, Eclipse IDE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaluchi/jdtbridge.git
cd jdtbridge/cli
npm install
npm link          # registers global `jdt` and `jdtbridge` commands
jdt setup         # builds plugin, installs into Eclipse
```

`jdt setup` handles everything: Maven build with tests, stops Eclipse if running, installs the plugin via p2, restarts Eclipse with the same workspace.

After pulling updates, run `jdt setup` again.

## Why CLI, not MCP?

MCP is the natural first thought for connecting an IDE to an AI agent. But JDT Bridge is a CLI — and that's a deliberate choice.

**Pipe composability is the killer feature.** MCP tool results go straight into the agent's context window, unfiltered. CLI output flows through the shell first:

```bash
# A 65-method DAO class, but you only care about folder operations.
# MCP: all 65 methods enter context. CLI: just the 27 that matter.
jdt ti com.example.dao.FileRepository | grep -i folder

# "How many call sites?" — you need a number, not 200 lines of references.
jdt refs com.example.core.Event dispatch | wc -l

# 47 compilation errors, but you're fixing them one at a time.
jdt err --project my-server | head -5

# Find where a method throws without reading all 80 lines of source.
jdt src com.example.util.StringHelper normalize | grep -A2 'throw'

# Chain semantic queries with standard tools.
jdt find '*Controller' | xargs -I{} jdt refs {} handleRequest | sort -u
```

An agent's context window is finite. Every irrelevant token displaces useful reasoning. MCP's [own community recognizes this](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1576) — token bloat from tool schemas and unfiltered results is a known problem, with projects like [model-context-shell](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/model-context-shell) trying to retrofit Unix-style pipes onto MCP.

**Works for everyone.** The same `jdt` command works in your terminal, in shell scripts, in CI, and for any AI agent. MCP requires per-IDE configuration and isn't directly usable by humans. When something goes wrong, you debug by running the same command the agent ran — no log spelunking.

**No lock-in.** Anything that can run a shell command can use `jdt` — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, aider, or a plain bash script. MCP support varies by IDE and changes with every release.

MCP is the right choice for things like database connections, OAuth flows, or cloud APIs with no CLI equivalent. But for developer tools where output filtering matters and humans benefit too, a CLI wins.

## Commands

Most commands have short aliases for quick typing.

| Command | Alias | What it does |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `projects` | | List workspace projects |
| `project-info <name>` | `pi` | Project overview (packages, types, methods) |
| `find <Name>` | | Find type declarations (supports `*wildcards*`) |
| `references <FQN> [method]` | `refs` | All references to a type, method, or field |
| `subtypes <FQN>` | `subt` | All subtypes and implementors |
| `hierarchy <FQN>` | `hier` | Full type hierarchy (supers + subs) |
| `implementors <FQN> <method>` | `impl` | Implementations of an interface method |
| `type-info <FQN>` | `ti` | Class overview (fields, methods, signatures) |
| `source <FQN> [method]` | `src` | Source code — project and library classes |
| `test <FQN> [method]` | | Run JUnit tests |
| `errors [--project <name>]` | `err` | Compilation errors and diagnostics |
| `organize-imports <file>` | `oi` | Organize imports (Eclipse settings) |
| `format <file>` | `fmt` | Format code (Eclipse settings) |
| `rename <FQN> <new>` | | Rename type, method, or field across workspace |
| `move <FQN> <package>` | | Move type to another package |
| `open <FQN> [method]` | | Open in Eclipse editor |
| `active-editor` | `ae` | Current file and cursor position |

Run `jdt help <command>` for detailed flags and options.

## How it works

```
  Terminal / AI agent              Eclipse IDE
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
|                    |  HTTP   |                    |
|   jdt CLI          | ------> |   JDT Bridge       |
|   (Node.js)        | JSON    |   plugin           |
|                    | <------ |   (JDT SearchEngine)|
+--------------------+         +--------------------+
        |                               |
   auto-discovers              writes instance file
        |                               |
        +--- ~/.jdtbridge/instances/ ---+
```

The Eclipse plugin starts a loopback HTTP server on a random port at startup. The CLI auto-discovers running instances via `~/.jdtbridge/instances/` files and routes commands to the right Eclipse.

Multiple Eclipse instances are supported — each writes its own instance file, keyed by workspace path.

**Security**: loopback-only binding (`127.0.0.1`), per-session random token, POSIX `rwx------` permissions on instance files.

## Documentation

- **[CLI reference](cli/README.md)** — all commands, flags, options, instance discovery
- **[HTTP API](plugin/README.md)** — raw endpoint reference for building custom clients

## Known limitations

- **Workspace must be fully built.** JDT search relies on the Eclipse index. If the workspace hasn't been fully indexed, results may be incomplete. Use `jdt errors --build` or `--clean` to trigger builds.
